    <p>After the Buddha’s enlightenment, he spent seven weeks in the vicinity of the Bodhi tree, 
      experiencing the bliss of liberation. 
      He then decided to share his realization with others. He walked to Sarnath, near Varanasi, where he met the five ascetics who had previously served him. The Buddha preached his first sermon, the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta, to them. This sermon is considered the first teaching of the Buddha and is known as the “Turning of the Wheel of Dhamma.” The Buddha explained the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path, which are the core teachings of Buddhism. The five ascetics became the first monks in the Buddhist community, known as the Sangha. The Buddha then spent the next 45 years traveling and teaching the Dhamma to people from all walks of life.</p>
