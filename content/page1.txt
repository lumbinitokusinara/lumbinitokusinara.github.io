Section 1: Birth of the Buddha Gotama 
In this section we will focus on the significance of the birth of Buddha as a bodhisatta and important incidents connected to his appearance in this world. Although the Tipitaka does not mention the details of the time of the Buddha's birth, according to South East Asian tradition it is accepted that the Buddha Gotama was born in 623 B.C. on the full moon day of the month of May (Ves?kha -Vesak) i. Most of his life he lived in the northern part of India, then known as ‘Middle Country” (majjhimadesa).ii

?Why the Birth of the Buddha is Significant?
The Buddha and his Dhamma—teachings are a vital source of wisdom and guidance for spiritual development. The significance of a Buddha in a human realm is that an enlightened being, a teacher who can guide people through suffering and discontent to the ultimate goal of Nibb?na iii , becomes available to humankind. The following extract from the scriptures focus on the significance of the birth of the Buddha:
“… there is one person who arises in the world for the welfare of many people, for the happiness of many people, out of compassion for the world, for the good, welfare, and happiness of devas and human beings …  Who is that one person? The Tath?gata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One…” iv

* Below is an extract from Light of Asia on the Buddha descending to this world
“…and on Lord Buddha, waiting in that sky,
Came for our sakes the five sure signs of birth
So that the Devas knew the signs, and said
”Buddha will go again to help the World.”
”Yea!” spoke He, “now I go to help the World
This last of many times; for birth and death
End hence for me and those who learn my Law.
I will go down among the S?kyas,
Under the southward snows of Himalay,
Where pious people live and a just King.” v
	
?The Bodhisatta descends from the Tu?ita Deva Realm
According to Buddhist scriptures, the Buddha was born in a human realm as a Bodhisatta vi,  having spent a period of time in the “deva” realm of Tu?ita’ vii.

Venerable ?nanda viii is quoted in the suttas, describing the birth of the Buddha:

“…I heard and learned this, Venerable Sir, from the Blessed One’s own lips: ‘Mindful and fully aware…the Bodhisatta appeared in the Tusita heaven …the Bodhisatta remained in the Tusita heaven …the Bodhisatta passed away from the Tusita heaven” and descended into his mother’s womb” ix . 
? The Bodhisatta was Born to a Royal Family
The Bodhisatta’s parents were King Suddhodana and Queen Mahamaya from the royal capital Kapilavattu in the Sakyan province x. Traditional Buddhist stories says that when the bodhisatta descended into the womb of Queen Mahamaya, she had a dream that a pure white elephant came near her bed xi.
Queen Maya’s Dream 
“One full moon night, sleeping in the palace, the queen had a vivid dream. She felt herself being carried away by four devas to Lake Anotatta in the Himalayas. After bathing her in the lake, the devas clothed her in heavenly cloths, anointed her with perfumes, and bedecked her with divine flowers. Soon after a white elephant, holding a white lotus flower in its trunk, appeared and went round her three times, entering her womb through her right side”.

? The Birth of the Bodhisatta at Lumbini Park
According to legend, King Suddhodana’s wife, Queen Maya left the city of Kapilavattu for her parents’ home in Devadaha to give birth to her child, the future Buddha. On the way, the Queen saw a beautiful park (Lumbini) with fragrant Sal flowers in bloom.  She entered the park with her entourage, bathed in a pond and walked towards a Sal tree and touched a branch full of flowers, at that moment the Bodhisatta was born xii

? Significant Events Occurred at the Birth
According to the scriptures, the birth of a Bodhisatta was distinctive, as is evident from the following statement by Venerable Ãnanda: 

? Great Power
“ I heard and learned this from the Blessed One’s own lips: 
… ‘other women give birth seated or lying down, but not so the Bodhisatta’s mother. The Bodhisatta’s mother gave birth to him standing up…when the Bodhisatta came forth from 
his mother’s womb, he did not touch the earth.  The four young gods received him and set him before his mother saying: ‘Rejoice, O queen, a son of great power has been born to you…’ then a great immeasurable light surpassing the splendour of the gods appeared in the world’”xiii
? Utterance at the Birth
 Scriptures say that as soon as the Bodhisatta was born, he stood firmly with his feet, and walked seven steps facing north; a whit a white parasol held over him, he surveyed each quarter and uttered:

“I am the highest in the world; I am the best in the world;
I am the foremost in the world. This is my last birth; 
now there is no renewal of being for me.” xiv

Note: Information of the Seven Steps are given here xvi.

* The Birth of Bodhisatta is glorified in the following poem of A?vagho?a


In that glorious grove, perceiving that it was time for the birth, 
The queen took to a bed covered over with an awning, 
being joyfully received into the bosom of thousands of fellow women.
Then, as a propitious moon passed into the asterism of Pu?ya, 
to that queen sanctified by the manner of her action – 
Through her, for the welfare of the world – 
a son was born, painlessly and healthily.
With brightness he shone, and with constancy, 
like a newly-risen sun inundating the earth; 
Thus, he blazed too brightly to be gazed upon, 
and at the same time, he stole the eyes, 
in the manner of the hare-marked moon.
For with the blazing light of his body, 
he blotted out the light of lamps as does the sun; 
And with his beautiful lustre of precious gold, 
he enlightened all directions.
With even footsteps, his feet rising up like water-born lotuses, 
and coming down in long stamping strides:
Seven such firm steps he took, looking like the Seven Seer cluster of stars xvii.

? Devas Rejoice in the Birth of Bodhisatta
Corresponding to scriptures, Sakka, the King of the Devas xviii and his retinue celebrated the 
 birth of the Buddha. The Seer Asita xix, witnessing the celebration of Devas, asked the reason for the celebration. Then Devas replied thus:

“The being intent on awakening, a peerless gem, has been born in the human realm for the sake of their welfare and happiness, in Lumbin?, a village in the Sakyan land. That’s why we’re so happy and in such excellent spirits. He is supreme among all beings, the best of people, chief of men, supreme among all creatures. He will roll forth the wheel in the grove of the seers, roaring like a mighty lion, lord of beasts.” xx

? Lumbini Park is the Place of Birth of the Gotama Buddha
In the Nepalese language ‘Lumbini’ means lovely. Tradition as well as also scriptures say that Lumbini, the Buddha’s birth place was located in the Sakyan Kingdom of North India (called Middle Country). Above we saw a verse sung by the devas rejoicing of the birth of the Buddha thus:
 “The being intent on awakening, a peerless gem, has been born in the human realm for the sake of welfare and happiness, in Lumbin?, a village in the Sakyan land”  xxi

? In the Pabbaja sutta of Suttanipata, replying to an inquiry by King Bimbisara of Magadha about his birth, the ascetic Siddhartha said this:

‘Up north, O King, on the slopes of the Himalayas,
full of wealth and strength, lies the land
of one whose abode is among the Kosalans.
Their clan is named for the Sun,
they are Sakyans by birth.
I have gone forth from that family—” xxii.














? The modern map of India (above) indicates that Lumbini is located in Nepal, near the border of India.  During the Buddha’s life, the Indian subcontinent, including now Nepal, was known as Jambud?pa. According to Buddhist scriptures, the Blessed One’s native place was called, Kapilavattu, the royal capital of the Sakyans, hence Lumbini is believed to have been located near the royal capital of Kapilavattu. Previously we saw the statement of Ascetic Siddhartha to King Bimbisara that he was from the Sakyan country, situated on the slopes of the Himalaya Mountain range xxiii. In the map below we can see that Kapilavattu is located below the Himalaya range.

?Evidence from Historical Sources of Lumbini as the Birth Place of the Buddha
?Asoka Pillar
According to history and archaeology, the first evidence from non-scriptural sources came through the discovery of an ancient pillar called the ‘Asoka Pillar at Lumbini’ built by the emperor Asoka. It seems that the King Asoka who became a follower of the Buddha, went on a pilgrimage to discover Buddhist sites around 248 B.C. (3rd century). When he visited Lumbini park, he built the monument as a mark of respect to the Buddha. xxiv
The discovery of the Asoka Pillar in Lumbini xxv in 1896 was an important finding. In the Mah? Parinibb?na Sutta (DN:16), the place where the Buddha was born is mentioned as one of the four places suitable for devoted Buddhist to visit and remember the greatest qualities of the Blessed One. xxvi

(He) both caused to be made a stone bearing a horse and caused a stone pillar to be set up, (in order to show) that the Blessed One was born here. (He) made the village of Lummini free of taxes, and paying (only) an eighth share (of the produce)” Source: Wikipedia.

<h3> Travelling Monks from China visiting India </h3>
The other significant events documenting Lumbini as the birthplace of the Buddha came from the two Chinese monks, Faxian, in the 5th century and Xuanzang in the 7th century. They were on a pilgrimage from China to India visiting ancient Buddhist sites. These two famous travellers from the Far East who visited Lumbini and many other important Buddhist palaces, recorded their travel encounters which later supported the archaeologists and other interested parties in locating the birth place of the Buddha and other similar sites.  xxvii

?The Buddha was from Sakyan Clan 
Numerous places in the scriptures point out that the Buddha belonged to the Sakyan clan, hence he was called ‘Sakya Muni’ (sage of Sakyan) and his disciples were called ‘Sakya Putta’ (son of Sakyans). The Sakyan’s Republic was on the edge of the Himalayas and Kapilavattu was their royal capital. The Sakyan Republic was subject to the King of Kosala. Tradition as well as scriptures say that King Okkaka was the forefather of the Sakyan clan. In Amba??ha Sutta (DN:3), we can see a passage related to this: 

? The Buddha said thus:
“…for the Sakyans regard King Okk?ka as their ancestor. At one time King Okk?ka,  to whom his queen was dear and beloved, wishing to transfer the kingdom to her son, banished his elder brothers from the kingdom — made their home on the flank of the Him?layas beside a lotus-pond where there was a big grove of teak-trees…Then King Okk?ka asked his ministers and counsellors: ‘Where are the princes living now?’ and they told him. At this King Okk?ha exclaimed: “They are strong as teak (s?ka), these princes, they are real Sakyans!” …and that is how the Sakyans got their well-known name. And the King was the ancestor of the Sakyans…’xxviii

? Sakyan (called khattiya) were rulers and considered to be proud people. During the Buddha’s time there were four classes: Brahmins who served as priests and scholars, Kshatriyas were warriors who were kings and rulers; Vaishyas were merchants and traders and; Shudras were labourers’ and servants. Some of the attributes given to Sakyan are given below:

* “The khattiya is the best among people for those whose standard is the clan…” xxix

* “…aim of khattiyas; their quest is for wisdom; their support is power; they are intent on territory; and their final goal is sovereignty.” xxx

? Tradition says that Kapilavattu had been named in honour of the sage Kapila. When the banished princes of King Okk?ka, went to the Himalayan range searching for a place to live, they saw the hermitage of sage Kapila, who welcomed them and helped them to settle down near his hermitage. Later when they resorted to their own royal status, they built a city and named it Kapilavattu to show their gratitude to sage Kapila xxxi

? In Mahâpad?na Sutta (DN:14) there is a passage where the devas’ mention that the city of Kapilavatthu is the native place of the Buddha: 
“…in this fortunate aeon now, the Lord Buddha has arisen in the world… his father is King Suddhodana, his mother was Queen Maya, and his royal capital is Kapilavattu…”.
? According to Mah?parinibb?na sutta (DN:16): When the Buddha passed away, the Sakyans from Kapilavatthu demanded relics of the Buddha thus:

“…the Sakyas of Kapilavattu heard (Parinibbana of the Buddha), and they sent a message: ‘The Lord was the chief of our clan. We are worthy to receive a share of the Lord’s remains, and we will make a great stupa for them… the Sakyans of Kapilavattu built one (stupa) at Kapilavattu”.

? Location of Kapilavattu
The map below shows the modern locations of Kapilavattu 1) site is in present day Nepal and the 2) site in Piprahawa of India.














? During the life of the Buddha, Kapilavattu was a well-known city in the northern part of Jambudvipa- now called the Indian sub-continent. The Sakyan Mah?n?ma a prominent member of Sakya clan, said this:

“… this Kapilavatthu is rich and prosperous, populous, crowded, with congested thoroughfares. In the evening, when I am entering Kapilavatthu after visiting the Blessed One or the bhikkhus worthy of esteem, I come across a stray elephant, a stray horse, a stray chariot, a stray cart, a stray man (roaming excitedly) …” xxxii

? According to tradition as well as scriptures it is said that Kapilavattu was destroyed by King Vidudabha, son of late king Pasenadi Kosala xxxiii . 

* Ruins of that city, the native place of the Buddha were discovered not long ago during the time of British India (1858-1947); archeologists found two possible sites, near the Nepal-Indian border, one in Nepal and the other in India. The site in Nepal is called Tilaurakot located in present day Kapilavattu District, and the other site is Piprahwa, a village near Siddharthnagar, in state of Uttar Pradesh, India xxxiv.
The controversy over the exact location of Kapilavattu is still unresolved. The map (above) shows that the two sites are not very far from each other (about 27 km apart) and are both close to, Lumbini, where prince Siddhartha was born.  Below are the pictures of the two sites:

vi “A being intended to become a future Buddha- is called Bodhisattva. During the time of the Buddha Dipankara, an asetic named Sumedha (Gotama Buddha) performing duties at the feet of the Buddha, aspired to obtain Buddha-hood, spent many aeons in the world system. After fullfilling all bodisattva duties, he paased away from the human world and appeared in the Tu?ita heaven as the future Buddha to be:see: KN: Buddhvamsa-Chariyapitaka: Sumedha Katha. Note: The Bodhsatta in Tusita was called Deva Setaketu,  source: The story of Sataketu Deva, The Great Chronicles of Buddhas by Venerable Mingun Sayadaw.
vii Tu?ita is one of the 6 deva realms above the human realm; A single night and day is equivalent to four hundred human years; the life span of those devas is four thousand such celestial years. In this realm all Bodhisattas, the  Buddha to be reside, until the time came to be born in thre human world and become a fully enlightened Buddha. See: AN:8: 41.

xvi The special events that occurred at the birth of Bodhisatta explains each as a foretoken of the Buddha’s later attainments.

xxv The Lumbini pillar inscription, also called the Paderia inscription, is an inscription in the ancient Brahmi script, discovered in December 1896 on a pillar of Ashoka in Lumbini, Nepal by former Chief of the Nepalese Army General Khadga Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana under the authority of Nepalese government and assisted by Alois Anton Führer… Initially, only the top of the pillar was visible, with a Medieval inscription on it. The Nepalese authorities dug around the pillar, to find the ancient Brahmi   inscription, which therefore had
  remained underground, hidden from view. The Brahmi inscription on the pillar gives evidence that Ashoka, emperor of the Maurya Empire, visited the place in 3rd-century BCE and identified it as the birth-place of the Buddha :See:  Wikepedia. * The architectural remains at the Maya Devi Temple include a pillar constructed by Emperor Ashoka in 249 BC, which contains inscriptions testifying to its location as the birthplace of the Buddha. Additional excavated remains of Buddhist monasteries and stupas dated between the 3rd century BC and the 15th century AD provide evidence around how Lumbini has been an important Buddhist pilgrimage site for centuries. The UNESCO website calls Lumbini “one of the most holy and significant places for one of the world’s great religions” and visitors liken it to a “Mecca for Buddhists.” see: WHS:https://worldheritagesites.net/lumbini-birthplace-of-buddha/

xxxiv  Notes: British landowner named William Claxton Peppe was clearing land at his estate in India near the village Piprahwa and excavated a large mound of earth from which emerged a brick stupa. At a depth of 18 feet, he found a stone coffer containing jewels, bone fragments, ashes, and five small vases, one of which was inscribed with a line, in Brahmi script, claiming to hold the remains of the Buddha…the inscription was authenticated… by the highly respected French orientalist Auguste Barth  and the vase acknowledged as containing the Buddha's remains. This find, along with the age and construction of the stupa and other artifacts on site, strongly suggested that Piprahwa was ancient Kapilavatthu. At Tilaurakot, meanwhile, Mukherjee excavated a number of structures and unearthed sculptures relating to the Buddha, terracotta figurines etc.… the ruins of what appeared to have been a fort, living quarters, and a monastic structure, as well as two stupas associated with Suddhodana and Maya. He submitted the reports on his work to the proper authorities, claiming to have identified Kapilavatthu, but Auguste Barth was not impressed, and his opinion carried more weight than Mukherjee's. Tilaurakot was not dismissed as the site of Kapilavatthu but, owing to the finds at Piprahwa, was not confirmed.  See: https://www.worldhistory.org/Kapilavastu/
