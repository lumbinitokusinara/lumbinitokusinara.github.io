<h1>Section 2: Childhood and Family Life of Prince Siddhartha</h1>
<p>In the previous section of this series, we delved into the remarkable birth of Prince Siddhartha and the extraordinary events surrounding his arrival into this world. Now, we explore his early years, from childhood to the transformative moment at the age of twenty-nine, when he left his royal life behind to embark on the path of an ascetic in search of liberation.</p>
<h2>The Family of Prince Siddhartha</h2>
<p>Prince Siddhartha’s name, Siddhartha, means “<b>he who achieves his goal,</b>” <b> </b><span id="Endnote1">[<a href="#endnote1">1</a>]</span> and indeed, his life would unfold to achieve the supreme goal of enlightenment, bringing profound peace and wisdom to countless beings. Born in the city of Kapilavattu, Prince Siddhartha belonged to the Sakya Clan, a noble family of rulers. His father, King Suddhodana, and his mother, Queen Mahamaya, were revered for their wisdom and compassion. <span id="Endnote2">[<a href="#endnote2">2</a>]</span> However, the life of this noble prince was marked by profound sorrow, as his mother, Queen Mahamaya, passed away just seven days after his birth. <span id="Endnote3">[<a href="#endnote3">3</a>]</span></p>
<p>In a gesture of love and compassion, Queen Prajapati, Queen Mahamaya’s sister and King Suddhodana’s second consort, stepped forward as the prince’s foster mother. Queen Prajapati would later become a prominent figure in the Buddha’s teachings, being the first to be ordained as a Bhikkhuni in the community of nuns, embodying the noble qualities of devotion and compassion.</p>
<p>Prince Siddhartha also had a half-brother, Prince Nanda, and a half-sister, Princess Nandā, children of King Suddhodana and Queen Prajapati, who were also part of the royal family that would witness the unfolding of his extraordinary destiny.</p>
<p>The scriptures beautifully recount the significance of Prince Siddhartha’s family. In the Mahāpadāna Sutta (DN:14), the Devas express the auspiciousness of the Buddha’s birth and his noble lineage:</p>
<p><i>“…In this fortunate aeon now, the Lord Buddha has arisen in the world… His father is King Suddhodana, his mother was Queen Maya, and his royal capital is Kapilavattu…”</i></p>
<p>In the Udana, Venerable Ānanda Thera reflects on the profound nature of the Buddha’s mother’s passing: <span id="Endnote4">[<a href="#endnote4">4</a>]</span></p>
<p><i>“…It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing! How short-lived was the Blessed One’s mother! For seven days after the Blessed One was born, his mother passed away and was reborn in the host of joyful gods (Tusita heaven)”</i></p>
<p>The Buddha, in his compassionate wisdom, explains:</p>
<p><i>“That’s so true, Ānanda! For the mothers of being’s intent on awakening are short-lived. Seven days after the being’s intent on awakening are born, their mothers pass away and are reborn in the host of joyful gods…”</i></p>
<p>This passage illuminates the deep connection between the Buddha’s life and the unfolding of his path to enlightenment, revealing the divine significance of his birth and the transcendent nature of his family. The early loss of his mother, though heartbreaking, set the stage for Siddhartha’s eventual awakening and the subsequent teachings that would uplift all beings.</p>
<p>The noble birth of Prince Siddhartha in the Sakyan family was not just a royal event; it was the beginning of a journey that would transcend worldly existence, ultimately bringing forth the wisdom that would guide countless beings to liberation. The compassion and the divine purpose behind his birth and his family’s role in his life serve as a profound reminder of the interconnectedness of all beings and the deep compassion that the Buddha embodied, not only for his family but for the entire world.</p>
<p><b>Ven. Kāludāyi Thera</b>, a devoted disciple of the Buddha, expressed the following: <span id="Endnote5">[<a href="#endnote5">5</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>“… </i><b><i>Suddhodana</i></b><i> is the name of the Great Seer’s father, and </i><b><i>Māyā</i></b><i> is the name of the Buddha’s mother, who, having nurtured the Bodhisatta in her womb, now rejoices in the threefold divine realm after the dissolution of her body. She, </i><b><i>Gotamī</i></b><i>, having passed away, has transcended this world and is now blessed with heavenly sensual pleasures…”</i></p>
<p>In the Dakkhiṇāvibhanga Sutta (MN:142), Venerable Ānanda also affirms that Queen Mahāpajāpatī was the Buddha’s foster mother. He states:</p>
<p><i>“… Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī has been of great assistance to the Blessed One, venerable sir. As his mother’s sister, she became his nurse and foster mother, the one who gave him milk. She suckled the Blessed One after his own mother passed away…”</i></p>
<p>Queen Prajāpati, reflecting on her unique role as the Buddha’s foster mother, said: <span id="Endnote6">[<a href="#endnote6">6</a>]</span></p>
<p><i>“… </i><b><i>Sublime One</i></b><i>, I am your foster mother, yet you nourished me with the milk of the </i><b><i>True Dhamma</i></b><i>. Therefore, you are my father… </i><b><i>Greatest Hero</i></b><i>, I raised you by nursing you, and you supported me in building this </i><b><i>Dhamma body</i></b><i>. I quenched your thirst with my breast milk, and the </i><b><i>Dhamma milk</i></b><i> you provided extinguished my worldly desires. While titles like ‘King’s mother’ and ‘King’s wife’ hold great significance, the title of ‘Buddha’s mother’ surpasses them all…”</i><span id="Endnote7">[<a href="#endnote7">7</a>]</span><i> </i></p>

<h2>Prince Siddhartha’s Childhood</h2>
<p>Prince Siddhartha grew up in the comfort of royalty, sheltered from the outside world. However, even in his early years, two significant and unusual spiritual events occurred, foreshadowing the path he would one day follow, as documented in the scriptures.</p>
<h3>Prophesy about Buddhahood</h3>
<p>The first event took place when the renowned ascetic, Asita (also known as Kāladevala), visited King Suddhodana to see the newborn prince. The ascetic, upon observing the child, prophesied that the baby would one day become a great spiritual leader: <span id="Endnote9">[<a href="#endnote9">9</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>“…He is supreme, the best of men! This boy shall reach the highest awakening. With perfectly purified vision, compassionate for the welfare of many, he will roll forth the wheel of the teaching. His spiritual path will spread far and wide…” </i><span id="Endnote10">[<a href="#endnote10">10</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>This prophecy marked the beginning of the divine significance of Prince Siddhartha’s life, setting the stage for his future as the Buddha.</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Meditative Attainment as a Child</h3>
<p>The second significant event took place during a ploughing festival organized by his father. At just seven years old, Prince Siddhartha was found meditating under a Rose Apple tree. In this serene moment, it is said that he entered the first Jhana, a deep state of meditation. This early experience of profound samadhi and mindfulness would later lay the foundation for his spiritual journey to enlightenment.</p>
<p>After attaining Buddhahood, the Blessed One recalled this moment from his childhood, describing it in the following way:</p>
<p><i>“…I recall that when my father, the Sakyan, was occupied, I sat in the cool shade of a rose-apple tree, completely secluded from sensual pleasures and free from unwholesome states. In this peaceful solitude, I entered and abided in the first jhāna, accompanied by applied and sustained thought, with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion…”</i><span id="Endnote12">[<a href="#endnote12">12</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>This early meditation marked the beginning of Prince Siddhartha’s connection with the path of inner peace, which would ultimately lead him to the realization of enlightenment.</p>

<h2>Young Prince Siddhartha </h2>
<p>According to the scriptures, prince Siddhartha lived in the royal palace in<b> </b>Kapilavattu, the capital of the Sakyan Clan until the age of twenty-nine. The Buddha recalls:</p>
<p><i>“I lived in lay life for twenty-nine years… Bhadda Kacchana  (Yashodhara) was my queen… Rahula was my son’ . </i><span id="Endnote14">[<a href="#endnote14">14</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>In this sutta the Buddha describes his princely life:</p>
<p><i>“…I was delicately nurtured…at my father’s residence lotus ponds were made just for my enjoyment: in one of them blue lotuses bloomed, in another red lotuses, and in a third white lotuses… I used no sandalwood unless it came from Kāsi and my headdress, jacket, lower garment, and upper garment were made of cloth from Kāsi … I had three mansions: one for the winter, one for the summer, and one for the rainy season… I spent the four months of the rains in the rainy-season mansion, being entertained by musicians, none of whom were male and I did not leave the mansion…”</i><b> </b><b> </b><span id="Endnote15">[<a href="#endnote15">15</a>]</span></p>
