<p><h1>The Buddha—The Awakened One</h1></p>
<p><i>The Pali term </i><b><i>“Buddha”</i></b><i> means </i><b><i>“the Awakened One”</i></b><i> or </i><b><i>“the Enlightened One”</i></b><i>—a title that signifies his perfect realization of the true nature of reality. He was known simply as </i><b><i>“the Buddha”</i></b><i> among his followers, and in the scriptures, we often see the Blessed One referring to himself by this name, embodying the essence of perfect wisdom and awakening.</i></p>
<p><h2>The Buddha—Knower of Liberation, Teacher of the Path</h2></p>
<p>The Buddha is revered as the one who not only attained liberation but also illuminated the path for others to follow. As he declared in the following sutta, he is called the Buddha because he realized four essential aspects of the path and guided beings toward freedom:</p>
<p><i>“Bhikkhus, it is because of not understanding and not penetrating noble virtuous behaviour, noble concentration, noble wisdom, and noble liberation that you and I have wandered through this long cycle of existence... But now, having fully understood and penetrated these truths…”</i></p>
<p>Then the Blessed One proclaimed:</p>
<p><i>“Virtuous behaviour, concentration, wisdom,</p>
<p>And unsurpassed liberation—</p>
<p>These the illustrious Gotama</p>
<p>Has realized by himself.</p>
<p>Having directly known these truths,</p>
<p>The Buddha teaches the Dhamma to the bhikkhus.</p>
<p>He is the Teacher, the end-maker of suffering,</p>
<p>The One with Vision, who has attained Nibbāna.” </i><span id="Endnote2">[<a href="#endnote2">2</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><h2>The Buddha—The Noble One Who Knows All</h2></p>
<p>The term <b>“Buddha”</b> also signifies the one who possesses perfect knowledge and insight. When the Brahmin Sela inquired about enlightenment, the Buddha responded with these profound words:</p>
<p><i>“What must be known is directly known,</p>
<p>What must be developed has been developed,</p>
<p>What must be abandoned has been abandoned,</p>
<p>Therefore, Brahmin, I am a Buddha.”</i></p>
<p>Deeply moved by the Blessed One’s wisdom, Brahmin Sela, with newfound confidence, proclaimed:</p>
<p><i>“You are the Buddha, you are the Teacher,</p>
<p>You are the Sage, the conqueror of Māra.</p>
<p>Having cut off all evil tendencies,</p>
<p>You have crossed and guide humanity across.” </i><span id="Endnote3">[<a href="#endnote3">3</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><h2>The Rare and Precious Arising of a Buddha</h2></p>
<p>The birth of a Buddha in the world is an event of immeasurable significance, a beacon of hope for beings lost in the cycle of suffering. The scriptures remind us of the precious rarity of such an occurrence:</p>
<p><i>“Difficult is it to obtain human birth,</p>
<p>Challenging is the life of mortals,</p>
<p>Rare it is to hear the true Dhamma,</p>
<p>And rarer still is the arising of a Buddha.” </i><span id="Endnote4">[<a href="#endnote4">4</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><h2>The Buddha is a Sublime Gem</h2></p>
<p></p>
<p>“There’s no wealth here or beyond,</p>
<p></p>
<p>no sublime gem in the heavens,</p>
<p></p>
<p>that equals the Realized One.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This sublime gem is in the Buddha:</p>
<p></p>
<p>by this truth, may you be well!” <span id="Endnote5">[<a href="#endnote5">5</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><h2>The Buddha is the Foremost in the World </h2></p>
<p></p>
<p>“In this world together with its devas</p>
<p></p>
<p>above, across, and below,</p>
<p></p>
<p>as far as the world extends,</p>
<p></p>
<p>the Buddha is declared foremost” <span id="Endnote6">[<a href="#endnote6">6</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><h2>The Nature of the Buddha</h2></p>
<p></p>
<p>“The perfect Buddhas of the past,</p>
<p></p>
<p>the Buddhas of the future,</p>
<p></p>
<p>and the present Buddha</p>
<p></p>
<p>who removes the sorrow of many:</p>
<p></p>
<p>all those dwelled, now dwell,</p>
<p></p>
<p>and in the future will dwell</p>
<p></p>
<p>revering the good Dhamma.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is the nature of the Buddhas”<span id="Endnote7">[<a href="#endnote7">7</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><h2>Buddha is peerless</h2></p>
<p></p>
<p>“When, through direct knowledge,</p>
<p></p>
<p>the Buddha, the teacher, the peerless person</p>
<p></p>
<p>in this world with its devas,</p>
<p></p>
<p>sets in motion the wheel of Dhamma,</p>
<p></p>
<p>he teaches personal existence, its cessation,</p>
<p></p>
<p>the origin of personal existence,</p>
<p></p>
<p>and the noble eightfold path</p>
<p></p>
<p>that leads to the calming down of suffering” <span id="Endnote8">[<a href="#endnote8">8</a>]</span></p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><h2>The Buddha—The Noble One Unsoiled by the World</h2></p>
<p>When Brahmin Dona first encountered the Blessed One, he was uncertain whether he was in the presence of a deva or a human. In his awe and curiosity, he asked the Buddha, and the Blessed One responded with these profound words: <span id="Endnote10">[<a href="#endnote10">10</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>“Just as a beautiful white lotus,</i> <i></p>
<p>Untouched by the water, remains pure,</p>
<p>So too, I am not soiled by the world.</p>
<p>Therefore, O Brahmin, I am a Buddha.”</i></p>
<p>These words express the Buddha’s transcendence over the defilements of the world, an untainted purity that arises from deep realization and mastery over the cycle of existence.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img src="page6/image3.jpeg" /></p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><h2>The Buddha—Emerging Like the Lotus from the Mud of Samsāra</h2></p>
<p>In the Sutta Nipāta, another verse beautifully describes how the Buddha, like the lotus, emerges from the muddy waters of samsāra: <i>”  </i><span id="Endnote11">[<a href="#endnote11">11</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>“Suppose there were a blue water lily,</p>
<p>Or a pink or white lotus.</p>
<p>Though it sprouted and grew in the water,</p>
<p>It would rise above the surface,</p>
<p>Unsoiled by the water that nourished it.</p>
<p>In the same way, though I was born and grew in the world,</p>
<p>I live, having mastered it,</p>
<p>Unsullied by the world.”</i></p>
<p>Just as the lotus stands tall and pure above the murky waters, the Buddha transcended the limitations of the world, embodying purity, wisdom, and peace, despite his physical presence within it.</p>
<p><h2>The Buddha—Worthy of All Offerings</h2></p>
<p>The Buddha is the unsurpassed field of merit, deserving of the highest reverence and offerings. As the scriptures reveal:</p>
<p><i>“The honourable Buddha deserves the sacrificial cake;</p>
<p>He is the unsurpassed field of merit,</p>
<p>The receptacle of sacrifice for all the world.</p>
<p>What is given to the worthy one brings great fruit.” </i><span id="Endnote12">[<a href="#endnote12">12</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>To offer to the Buddha is to plant seeds of immeasurable merit, for in him is the embodiment of the highest truth, a beacon that guides all beings towards liberation.</p>
<p><h1>Tathāgata—The Fully Awakened One</h1></p>
<p>In the scriptures, the Buddha referred to himself, his disciples, and followers as ‘Tathāgata’, a title meaning “the Fully Awakened One.” <span id="Endnote13">[<a href="#endnote13">13</a>]</span> The term can be understood as “one who has thus (tatha) gone (gata)” or “one who has thus (tatha) come (agata)”, signifying a being who has transcended all delusions and has attained perfect enlightenment. The following quotes from the scriptures reveal why the Buddha is called Tathāgata.</p>
<p><h2>Tathāgata is Fully Awakened</h2></p>
<p>The Buddha explained:</p>
<p><i>“…Bhikkhus, in this world with its devas, Māra, Brahmā, and humans… whatever is seen, heard, sensed, cognized, reached, sought after, examined by the mind—all that the Tathāgata has fully awakened to; therefore, he is called Tathāgata. Whatever the Tathāgata speaks, utters, or expounds in the interval between the night when he awakens to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment and the night when he attains final Nibbāna, all that is just so and not otherwise. Therefore, as the Tathāgata speaks, so he does; as he does, so he speaks. Since he does as he speaks and speaks as he does, therefore… in this world with its devas, the Tathāgata is the vanquisher, the unvanquished, the universal seer, the wielder of mastery; therefore, he is called Tathāgata.”</i><i> </i><span id="Endnote14">[<a href="#endnote14">14</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>In these words, the Buddha emphasizes his perfect realization, where nothing in the world escapes his awakened understanding, and his actions are in perfect harmony with his words.</b></p>
<p><h2>Tathāgata is the Accomplished One</h2></p>
<p>When the Five Ascetics <span id="Endnote15">[<a href="#endnote15">15</a>]</span> addressed the Buddha as "friend," the Blessed One responded:</p>
<p><i>“Do not address the Tathāgata by name and as a ‘friend.’ The Tathāgata is the Accomplished One, the Fully Enlightened One. Listen… the Deathless has been attained.” </i><span id="Endnote16">[<a href="#endnote16">16</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>The Buddha’s awakening is not just an ordinary realization but the supreme attainment—the Deathless—the realization of the eternal truth beyond birth and death.</p>
<p><h2>Tathāgata Appears for the Welfare of the World</h2></p>
<p>The Buddha also said:</p>
<p><i>“…There is one person who arises in the world for the welfare of many people, for the happiness of many people, out of compassion for the world. The manifestation of this person is rare in the world—extraordinary, unique, without peer, incomparable, matchless, unrivaled, unequalled, the foremost of bipeds. The manifestation of this one person is the manifestation of great vision, great light, the realization of the fruit of true knowledge and liberation, the realization of the fruit of stream-entry, arahantship… Who is this one person? The Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One.”</i><i> </i><span id="Endnote17">[<a href="#endnote17">17</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>The Buddha’s appearance in the world is a rare and extraordinary event, a beacon of compassion and wisdom for the benefit of all beings, guiding them toward liberation.</p>
<p><h2>Tathāgata—The Embodiment of Distinguishing Qualities</h2></p>
<p>The following suttas beautifully expound upon the noble qualities of the Tathāgata: <span id="Endnote18">[<a href="#endnote18">18</a>]</span><i>“Having renounced sensual pleasures, triumphant in his journey,</p>
<p>He who has known the end of birth and death,</p>
<p>Who has attained Nibbāna, as cool and serene as a lake,</p>
<p>The Tathāgata is worthy of the sacrificial cake.</p>
<p>Just as the righteous are far from the unrighteous,</p>
<p>The Tathāgata stands as one of boundless wisdom,</p>
<p>Untainted here and beyond—</p>
<p>The Tathāgata is worthy of the sacrificial cake.”</i></p>
<p>These verses illuminate the purity and perfection of the Tathāgata. Having transcended all attachments and delusions, the Buddha is a beacon of wisdom and peace, untouched by the fleeting world. He embodies the supreme realization of Nibbāna—utterly serene, utterly liberated.</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><h2>The Householder Upāli Honors the Tathāgata</h2></p>
<p>The householder Upāli, deeply moved by the Buddha's qualities, expressed:<span id="Endnote20">[<a href="#endnote20">20</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>“Of supreme serenity, with vast and infinite wisdom,</p>
<p>A man of great wisdom, devoid of all greed,</p>
<p>He is the Tathāgata, the Sublime One,</p>
<p>The person unrivaled, without equal;</p>
<p>He is intrepid, proficient in all,</p>
<p>The Blessed One is he, and I am his disciple.”</i></p>
<p>Upāli recognizes the Buddha as the embodiment of wisdom, serenity, and mastery, acknowledging that the Blessed One stands alone—unrivaled, incomparable, and an inspiration to all who seek the truth.</p>
<p><h1>Sammā Sambuddha—The Fully Enlightened Buddha</h1></p>
<p>Among the nine noble qualities attributed to the Buddha is the title Sammā Sambuddha, meaning “he who has attained enlightenment by his own efforts.” This title reflects the Buddha’s remarkable journey of self-realization, achieved without a teacher. Through his own wisdom and determination, the Buddha rediscovered the ancient path to liberation. He then dedicated his life to sharing this path with others, teaching the Dhamma, and establishing a community of followers who continue to support and carry forward the Buddha Sasana—the dispensation of the Buddha. <span id="Endnote21">[<a href="#endnote21">21</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><h2></h2></p>
<p><h2>Homage to the Blessed One—The Fully Enlightened One</h2></p>
<p>The Buddhist world also referred to the Buddha in this way. In during their daily chanting the Buddhists, pay homage to the Blessed One like thus:</p>
<p><i>“Namotassa Bhagavato Arahato Sammā Sambuddhassa”</i></p>
<p>(Homage to the Blessed One, Accomplished and Fully Enlightened One)</p>
<p>This homage acknowledges the Buddha’s profound realization and the boundless wisdom he embodies. Let us explore the wisdom within the scriptures that explains why the Buddha is called the Fully Enlightened One.</p>
<p><h2>The Buddha as the Perfectly Enlightened One</h2></p>
<p>The Buddha explained to his disciples:</p>
<p><i>“Bhikkhus, the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One, liberated by non-clinging through revulsion towards form, feeling, perception, volitional formations, and consciousness—through their fading away and cessation—is called the Perfectly Enlightened One.” </i><span id="Endnote22">[<a href="#endnote22">22</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>The Buddha's liberation came through the profound understanding of the impermanence of all things and his ultimate freedom from attachment and suffering. This profound realization is what defines his enlightenment.</p>
<p><h3>In the Mahāpadāna Sutta (DN: 14), the Buddha declares:</h3></p>
<p><i>“And, monks, in this present fortunate aeon, I too have now arisen in the world as a fully enlightened Buddha… I am now the Arahant and fully enlightened Buddha, and am of the Gotama clan.”</i></p>
<p>Through his own efforts, the Buddha realized the supreme truth, breaking free from the cycle of birth and death to attain the highest state of enlightenment.</p>
<p><h2>King Pasenadi's Recognition of the Buddha's Enlightenment</h2></p>
<p>Once, King Pasenadi of Kosala <span id="Endnote23">[<a href="#endnote23">23</a>]</span> approached the Buddha and asked:</p>
<p><i>“Does Master Gotama too claim, ‘I have awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment’? </i><span id="Endnote24">[<a href="#endnote24">24</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>The Buddha replied:</p>
<p><i>“I, great king, have awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment.”</i></p>
<p>This simple yet profound affirmation from the Buddha reveals the depths of his realization—one that transcends all worldly limitations and brings liberation to all beings.</p>
<p><h2>Why the Buddha is Called Sammāsambuddha</h2></p>
<p>In another sutta, the Buddha explains why he is called Sammā Sambuddha:</p>
<p><i>“Bhikkhus, there are these Four Noble Truths. What four? The noble truth of suffering… the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering. It is because he has fully awakened to these Four Noble Truths as they really are that the Tathāgata is called the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One.” </i><span id="Endnote25">[<a href="#endnote25">25</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The Buddha’s perfect awakening comes from his deep understanding of the Four Noble Truths—the essence of his teaching, the path to liberation, and the cessation of all suffering.</p>
<p><h2>Noble Qualities of the Fully Enlightened Being</h2></p>
<p>The scriptures also describe the Buddha’s supreme qualities:</p>
<p><i>“He has severed craving and become the Enlightened One,</p>
<p>Cleared of all fumes, completely untainted;</p>
<p>Most worthy of gifts, most mighty of spirits,</p>
<p>Most perfect of persons, beyond estimation;</p>
<p>The greatest in grandeur, attained the peak of glory:</p>
<p>The Blessed One is he, and I am his disciple.” </i><span id="Endnote26">[<a href="#endnote26">26</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>The Buddha is the embodiment of purity, wisdom, and compassion—his qualities are incomparable, his glory boundless.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Jina—The Victor<b> </b><span id="Endnote27">[<a href="#endnote27">27</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>The Buddha also called himself ‘Jina’, meaning “the Victor”—the conqueror who defeated Māra’s forces and won the supreme victory: the Buddhahood.</p>
<p>In one instance, while traveling towards Benares (Varanasi), the wandering ascetic Ājīvaka Upaka <span id="Endnote28">[<a href="#endnote28">28</a>]</span>saw the Buddha and asked:</p>
<p><i>“Sir, your senses are clear and your skin is pure and bright. In whose name have you gone forth? Who is your teacher, whose teaching do you follow?”</i> <span id="Endnote29">[<a href="#endnote29">29</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>In this moment, Upaka recognized the extraordinary radiance of the Buddha, a radiance that revealed the depth of his inner victory over all obstacles and defilements.</p>
<p>The Buddha replied:</p>
<p><i>“I am the victor, the knower of all. Having abandoned everything, I am not soiled by anything. Through my own insight, I am freed by the ending of craving—so, who should I call my teacher? I have no teacher;</p>
<p>No one like me exists in the world, with its gods; I have no equal.”</i></p>
<p><b>Note:</b><i> </i>The title “Jina” is also known as “Anantajina” — Universal Victor. See: MN:26. This verse is also mentioned in the Dhammapada (Dhp:353).</p>
<p><h2>Cunda the Smith’s Son Asks About the Conqueror</h2></p>
<p>On one occasion, Cunda, <span id="Endnote30">[<a href="#endnote30">30</a>]</span>  the smith's son, asked the Buddha:</p>
<p><i>“Whom do the Buddhas call a conqueror of the path?”</i></p>
<p>The Buddha replied:</p>
<p><i>“One who has crossed over perplexity, free of inner darts,</p>
<p>Delighted with Nibbāna, without any greed;</p>
<p>The guide of this world together with its devas:</p>
<p>The Buddhas call the impartial one a conqueror of the path.” </i><span id="Endnote31">[<a href="#endnote31">31</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><h2>Devas Addressing the Buddha as Victor</h2></p>
<p>Āṭānāṭiya Sutta (DN:32), we see Devas paying homage to the Buddha as Victor (Conqueror)</p>
<p><i>“Often asked, do we revere Gotama the Conqueror? —</p>
<p>We reply: ‘We do revere Gotama, great Conqueror,</p>
<p>In wisdom trained, in conduct too,</p>
<p>Buddha Gotama, we hail!’”</i></p>
<p><h2>Disciples Addressing the Buddha as Victor</h2></p>
<p>In the Therīgāthā, an elder nun recounts her struggle over twenty-five years and how, remembering the Buddha’s teachings, she found peace:</p>
<p><b><i>“</i></b><i>In the twenty-five years since I went forth,</p>
<p>I don’t know that I had ever found serenity in my mind.</p>
<p>I had failed to find peace of heart,</p>
<p>Or any control over my mind.</p>
<p>When I remembered the victor’s instructions,</p>
<p>I was struck with a sense of urgency.” </i><span id="Endnote32">[<a href="#endnote32">32</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><h1>Other Titles Attributed to the Buddha</h1></p>
<p>The scriptures also mention three other titles for the Buddha: ‘Brahmin’, ‘<b>One bearing his last body’</b>, and ‘<b>An unsurpassed physician and surgeon’</b>. The Buddha spoke to the Sangha:</p>
<p><i>“Bhikkhus, I am a Brahmin, ever accessible to entreaties, open-handed,</p>
<p>One bearing his last body, an unsurpassed physician and surgeon.</p>
<p>You are my legitimate sons, born from my mouth,</p>
<p>Born of Dhamma, fashioned by Dhamma, heirs of Dhamma,</p>
<p>Not heirs of material things.”</i> <span id="Endnote33">[<a href="#endnote33">33</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><h1>Brahmin </h1></p>
<p>In the scriptures the Buddha often used the word ‘<b>brahmin’</b> to referred to himself and his noble disciples who were arahants <span id="Endnote34">[<a href="#endnote34">34</a>]</span>.</p>
<p><i>“When things become clear to the keen, meditating brahmin, he remains, scattering Māra’s army, as the sun lights up the sky”</i><b> </b><span id="Endnote35">[<a href="#endnote35">35</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>“The brahmin who has shut out bad qualities, who is humble, free from flaws, and self-controlled, who has reached final knowledge and has fulfilled the spiritual life”</i><span id="Endnote36">[<a href="#endnote36">36</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>At one time a monk asked the Buddha of things make one a brahmin.</p>
<p>The Buddha said:</p>
<p><i>“Those who, having removed bad things, live always mindful,</p>
<p>The Buddhas who have destroyed the fetters,</p>
<p>truly they are brahmanas in the world."</i><span id="Endnote37">[<a href="#endnote37">37</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>When a devata realizing that the Buddha has crossed over the samsara he addressed the Buddha as ‘brahmin’:</p>
<p><i>“After a long time at last I see</i></p>
<p><i>A brahmin who is fully quenched,</i></p>
<p><i>Who by not halting, not straining,</i></p>
<p><i>Has crossed over attachment to the world”</i><span id="Endnote38">[<a href="#endnote38">38</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>When asked by a young deva Dāmali , the Buddha explained who a ‘brahmin’ is:</p>
<p>“For the brahmin there is no task to be done...</p>
<p>For the brahmin has done what should be done.</p>
<p>While he has not gained a footing in the river,</p>
<p>A man will strain with all his limbs;</p>
<p>But a footing gained, standing on the ground,</p>
<p>He need not strain for he has gone beyond.</p>
<p>This is a simile for the brahmin, O Dāmali,</p>
<p>For the taintless one, the discreet meditator.</p>
<p>Having reached the end of birth and death,</p>
<p>He need not strain for he has gone beyond.”<span id="Endnote39">[<a href="#endnote39">39</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><h1>Antimadehadhari- Bearer of the Final Body</h1></p>
<p>Buddha and arahants are noble beings that carry the last body and called Bearer of the Final Body—because they have destroyed all taints, therefore, no rebirth for them <span id="Endnote40">[<a href="#endnote40">40</a>]</span>. Following extracts from scriptures shows that the Buddha and Arahant bear the final body.</p>
<p><i>“…a bhikkhu is an arahant, consummate, with taints destroyed, one who bears his final body…” </i> <span id="Endnote41">[<a href="#endnote41">41</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>“Having known the exquisiteness of form, the origination of feelings, how perception arises, and where it disappears; having known volitional activities as alien, as suffering, and not as self—truly, that bhikkhu who sees rightly, peaceful, delights in the peaceful state. He bears his final body, having conquered Māra and his mount.” </i><span id="Endnote42">[<a href="#endnote42">42</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>In the <i>Samyutta Nikaya</i> (SN2:24), there is an incident where the Buddha meets Brahma Deva Ghaṭīkāra, a friend from a past life. At the end of this sutta, it is revealed that both the Buddha and Brahma Deva Ghaṭīkāra are bearers of their final bodies:</p>
<p><i>“Such was the meeting that took place </i></p>
<p><i>Between those friends from the past, </i></p>
<p><i>both now inwardly developed, </i></p>
<p><i>Bearers of their final bodies” </i><span id="Endnote43">[<a href="#endnote43">43</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><h3>In another sutta, the Buddha affirms that he bears his final body:</h3></p>
<p><i>“He who is concentrated, who has crossed the flood,</p>
<p>and has known the Dhamma with the supreme view,</p>
<p>whose influxes are destroyed, who bears his final body:</p>
<p>the Tathāgata is worthy of the sacrificial cake”</i><span id="Endnote44">[<a href="#endnote44">44</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><h3>The Buddha, having gone beyond all attachments, carries his final body:</h3></p>
<p><i>“One virtuous, wise, of developed mind,</p>
<p>Concentrated, mindful, enjoying jhāna,</p>
<p>For whom all sorrows are gone, abandoned,</p>
<p>A taint-destroyer bearing his final body.” </i><span id="Endnote45">[<a href="#endnote45">45</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>Upali, a former follower of Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta, who became a disciple of the Buddha after hearing the Dhamma, praised the Buddha in these words:</p>
<p>“Free from perplexity, he abides contented,</p>
<p>spurning worldly gains, a vessel of gladness;</p>
<p>A human being who has done the recluse’s duty,</p>
<p>a man <b>who bears his final body</b>;</p>
<p>He is utterly peerless and utterly spotless:</p>
<p>The Blessed One is he, and I am his disciple” <span id="Endnote46">[<a href="#endnote46">46</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><h1>An Unsurpassed Physician and Surgeon</h1></p>
<p>The Buddha is also honoured with the title <i>Anuttaro Bhisakko Sallakatto</i>, the Unsurpassed Physician and Surgeon, for he cures the suffering of beings trapped in samsara with the noble medicine of the Four Noble Truths. Indeed, he is the Supreme Physician. The following sutta shows the Buddha identifying himself as such:</p>
<p><i>“I am the one whose presence in the world </i></p>
<p><i>Is very rarely come upon, </i></p>
<p><i>I am the Fully Enlightened One, </i></p>
<p><i>I, O brahmin, am the supreme physician” </i><span id="Endnote47">[<a href="#endnote47">47</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><h2>The Buddha as the Supreme Physician</h2></p>
<p>The Buddha, like a compassionate physician, offers the noble purgative known as the Eightfold Path to beings suffering from the illness of samsara, guiding them to freedom from suffering. As the scriptures reveal:</p>
<p><i>“…bhikkhus, this is the noble purgative that always succeeds and never fails. In dependence on this path, beings subject to birth are freed from birth; beings subject to old age are freed from old age; beings subject to death are freed from death; beings subject to sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and anguish are freed from sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and anguish.” </i><span id="Endnote48">[<a href="#endnote48">48</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><h2>The Buddha’s Healing Power</h2></p>
<p>The following extracts from the scriptures demonstrate how the Buddha, as a spiritual physician, cures beings from the malady of worldly life:</p>
<p>Telakāni Bhikkhu expresses how he was relieved from the poison of samsara through the Buddha’s guidance: <span id="Endnote49">[<a href="#endnote49">49</a>]</span></p>
<p><i>“Dragging it along,</p>
<p>I’m not free from grief and lamentation.</p>
<p>Who will free me from bonds in the world,</p>
<p>So that I may know about awakening?</p>
<p>...He taught the supreme path</p>
<p>For the cancelling of these.</p>
<p>For a long time, it had lain within me;</p>
<p>For a long time, it was fixed in me:</p>
<p>The Buddha cast off the knot,</p>
<p>Curing the damage of poison.”</i></p>
<p>Ubbirī, a queen of Pasenadi Kosala, grieved for the death of her only daughter, but was healed through the Buddha’s wisdom: <span id="Endnote50">[<a href="#endnote50">50</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>“Oh! For you have plucked the arrow from me, </i></p>
<p><i>so hard to see, stuck in the heart.</i></p>
<p><i>You’ve swept away the grief for my daughter</i></p>
<p><i>in which I once was mired.</i></p>
<p><i>Today I’ve plucked the arrow,</i></p>
<p><i>I’m hungerless, quenched.</i></p>
<p><i>I go for refuge to that sage, </i></p>
<p><i>the Buddha, to his teaching, and to the Sangha.”</i></p>
<p>Brahmin Piṅgiyānī, <span id="Endnote51">[<a href="#endnote51">51</a>]</span> a true follower of the Buddha, compares the Buddha’s teaching to the skilful actions of a capable physician:</p>
<p><i>“Just as a capable physician might instantly cure one who is afflicted, sick, and gravely ill; so too, sir, whatever one hears of Master Gotama’s Dhamma—discourses, mixed prose and verse, expositions, or amazing accounts—one’s sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and anguish will vanish.”</i> <span id="Endnote52">[<a href="#endnote52">52</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><h2>The Buddha’s Care for the Physically Unwell</h2></p>
<p>The Buddha’s compassion extended beyond the spiritual realm; he also attended to the physical well-being of those who were unwell. In the <i>Vinaya Pitaka</i>, particularly in the <i>Bhesajjakkhandhaka</i>, there is abundant evidence of the Buddha’s care for the physical comfort of beings in need. <span id="Endnote53">[<a href="#endnote53">53</a>]</span></p>

<p><b>The Blessed One attending to a sick monk</b><span id="Endnote54">[<a href="#endnote54">54</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><h2>The Buddha’s Compassionate Service: Attending to a Sick Monk</h2></p>
<p>An incident from the <i>Vinaya Pitaka</i> illustrates the Buddha’s selfless service and compassionate care. The Buddha set an example for others by attending to a sick monk who had been abandoned by the rest of the community. <i>”</i><span id="Endnote55">[<a href="#endnote55">55</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>On one occasion, a monk suffering from dysentery lay in his own feces and urine. As the Buddha walked through the dwellings with Venerable Ānanda, he arrived at the sick monk’s dwelling. Upon seeing his condition, the Buddha approached and asked:</p>
<p><i>“What’s your illness, monk?”</p>
<p>“I have dysentery, Sir.”</p>
<p>“But don’t you have a nurse?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Why don’t the monks nurse you?”</p>
<p>“Because I don’t do anything for them.”</i></p>
<p>Moved with compassion, the Buddha said to Ānanda, “Go and fetch some water, Ānanda. Let us give him a wash.” After washing the sick monk and changing his robes, the monk, named Tissa <span id="Endnote56">[<a href="#endnote56">56</a>]</span>, felt comforted and happy. Standing near him, the Blessed One, knowing that monk Tissa was about to die and had the ability to break through, spoke:</p>
<p><b>“</b>Monk, consciousness will depart from you, and your body will become useless, lying on the ground like a log.”</p>
<p><i>(Ciraṃ vatayaṃ kāyo paṭhaviṃ adhisessati,</i></p>
<p><i> chuddho apetaviññāṇo niratthaṃ'va kaliṅgaraṃ)</i> <span id="Endnote57">[<a href="#endnote57">57</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Upon hearing these words, monk Tissa attained arahantship and passed away soon after.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To teach the community, the Buddha remarked<b>:</b></p>
<p><b>“</b><i>Monks, you have no mother or father to nurse you. If you do not nurse one another, who will? Whoever would nurse me, should nurse one who is sick.” </i><span id="Endnote58">[<a href="#endnote58">58</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><h3>He further taught:</h3></p>
<p>“The greatest of all gains is health; Nibbāna is the greatest bliss. The Eightfold Path is the best of paths, for it leads safely to the Deathless.”<span id="Endnote59">[<a href="#endnote59">59</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><h3>Guidelines for Caregivers </h3></p>
<p>The Buddha not only cared for sick monks but also gave detailed guidance on the qualities required for caregivers, emphasizing selflessness, mindfulness, and compassion. He outlined the following qualities for those who would attend to the sick:</p>
<p></p>
<p>1)	Capable of preparing medicine</p>
<p></p>
<p>2)	Knowledge of what is beneficial and harmful, with the ability to remove what is harmful and bring what is beneficial</p>
<p></p>
<p>3)	Able to nurse the sick with goodwill, not for worldly gain</p>
<p></p>
<p>4)	Not disgusted by the need to clean up feces, urine, spit, or vomit</p>
<p>Able to instruct, inspire, and gladden the sick with Dhamma teachings from time to time <span id="Endnote60">[<a href="#endnote60">60</a>]</span></p>
<p><h1>Cakkhumā- The One with of Vision</h1></p>
<p>‘Cakkhumā’ is a title ascribed to the Buddha, meaning the "One with Vision" or "Clear-eyed One." The Buddha is called Cakkhumā because he possesses spiritual insight into the path of liberation, seeing deeply into the nature of suffering, the path to freedom, and the realization of Nibbāna.</p>
<p>In the scriptures, the Buddha is described as Cakkhumā in the following ways:</p>
<p><h3>In here the Buddha reflects on his own understanding:</h3></p>
<p><i>“Virtuous behaviour, samādhi wisdom, and unsurpassed liberation: these things the illustrious Gotama understood by himself. Having directly known these things; the Buddha taught the Dhamma to the bhikkhus. The Teacher, the end-maker of suffering, the One with Vision, has attained nibbāna’.</i></p>
<p>(<i>Iti buddho abhiññāya, dhammamakkhāsi bhikkhunaṃ; Dukkhassantakaro satthā, </i><b><i>cakkhumā</i></b><i> parinibbuto’’ti. paṭhamaṃ)</i><span id="Endnote61">[<a href="#endnote61">61</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><h3>In the Dhammapada:</h3></p>
<p>“ Of paths, the eightfold is the best of truths,</p>
<p>the four statements; dispassion is the best of things,</p>
<p>and the Clear-eyed One is the best of humans.”</p>
<p><i>(maggānaṭṭhaṅgiko seṭṭho saccānaṃ caturo padā</i></p>
<p><i>virāgo seṭṭho dhammānaṃ dvipadānaṃ ca cakkhumā) </i><span id="Endnote62">[<a href="#endnote62">62</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>In the Sakkapañha Sutta (<b>DN:21), a young Deva named Gopka addresses the Buddha as “He-Who-Sees”:</b></p>
<p>“Each for himself must understand</p>
<p>That Dhamma taught by Him-Who-Sees,</p>
<p>And well-proclaimed. I, serving you,</p>
<p>Heard the Noble Ones’ good words,</p>
<p>And so, I’m born, a Sakka-son”</p>
<p><h1>Vesarājja-The Self-Confident One</h1></p>
<p>Vesarājja’ means "One with supreme self-confidence." This epithet describes the Buddha because he possessed four types of self-confidence. The following quote from the scriptures elaborates on these four qualities:</p>
<p><h2>The Buddha’s Four Kinds of Self-Confidence</h2></p>
<p>"Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of self-confidence that the Tathāgata has, possessing which he claims the place of the chief bull, roars his lion’s roar in the assemblies, and sets in motion the Brahma wheel. <span id="Endnote63">[<a href="#endnote63">63</a>]</span>  What four?</p>
<p></p>
<p>1)	"I do not see any ground on the basis of which an ascetic or brahmin, or deva, or Māra, or Brahmā, or anyone in the world might reasonably reprove me, saying: ‘Though you claim to be perfectly enlightened, you are not fully enlightened about these things.’ Since I do not see any such ground, I dwell securely, fearless, and self-confident.<i> </i><span id="Endnote64">[<a href="#endnote64">64</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>2)	"I do not see any ground on the basis of which an ascetic or brahmin, or deva, or Māra, or Brahmā, or anyone in the world might reasonably reprove me, saying: ‘Though you claim to be one whose taints are destroyed, you have not fully destroyed these taints.’ Since I do not see any such ground, I dwell securely, fearless, and self-confident.</p>
<p></p>
<p>3)	"I do not see any ground on the basis of which an ascetic or brahmin, or deva, or Māra, or Brahmā, or anyone in the world might reasonably reprove me, saying: ‘These things that you have said to be obstructive are not able to obstruct one who engages in them.’ Since I do not see any such ground, I dwell securely, fearless, and self-confident.</p>
<p></p>
<p>4)	"I do not see any ground on the basis of which an ascetic or brahmin, or deva, or Māra, or Brahma, or anyone in the world might reasonably reprove me, saying: ‘The Dhamma does not lead one who practices it to the complete destruction of suffering, the goal for the sake of which you teach it.’ Since I do not see any such ground, I dwell securely, fearless, and self-confident.”</p>
<p><h2>The Buddha Does Not Need to Hide Anything</h2></p>
<p>The Buddha’s openness and irreproachability further solidified his self-confidence. He openly stated that there are four things about which he has no need to hide, and three things for which he is beyond reproach: <span id="Endnote65">[<a href="#endnote65">65</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>1)	Bodily behaviour: His bodily behaviour is purified.</p>
<p></p>
<p>2)	Verbal behaviour: His verbal behaviour is purified.</p>
<p></p>
<p>3)	Mental behaviour: His mental behaviour is purified.</p>
<p></p>
<p>4)	Livelihood: His livelihood is purified.</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: The four things mentioned here align with the self-confidence the Buddha holds, as detailed in the <i>Mahāsihanāda Sutta</i> (MN:12).</p>
<p><h1>Ãdicca Bandhu - Kinsman of the Sun </h1></p>
<p><b>‘</b>Ādicca Bandhu’ is a frequently used epithet for the Buddha, meaning “Kinsman of the Sun” (<i>Ādicca</i> = Sun, <i>bandhu</i> = relative). According to legend, the Buddha’s clan, the Sakyan clan, was referred to as <i>Ādicca bandhu</i>, which is why the Buddha was often addressed by this title. .<span id="Endnote66">[<a href="#endnote66">66</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><h2>The Buddha as the Kinsman of the Sun</h2></p>
<p>In the following sutta, the Buddha refers to himself as the ‘Kinsman of the Sun’:</p>
<p>“<i>Restraint and abandonment, development and protection: these four strivings were taught by the Kinsman of the Sun. By these means, an ardent bhikkhu here can attain the destruction of suffering.”</i> <span id="Endnote67">[<a href="#endnote67">67</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>In the Suttanipāta<b><i> </i></b><b>a seeker of Dhamma addresses the Buddha as the “Kinsman of the Sun”:</b></p>
<p>“Great seer, I ask you, the Kinsman of the Sun, about seclusion and the state of peace.” <span id="Endnote68">[<a href="#endnote68">68</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><h2>Disciples’ Reverence for the Buddha</h2></p>
<p>The following verses from the <i>Theragāthā</i> show that the disciples of the Blessed One also referred to him as the “Kinsman of the Sun”</p>
<p><i>“Having heard the fine words of the Buddha, </i></p>
<p><i>the Kinsman of the Sun, </i></p>
<p><i>I penetrated the subtle truth,</i></p>
<p><i>like a hair-tip with an arrow”</i> <span id="Endnote69">[<a href="#endnote69">69</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>“<i>All are sons of the Blessed One—there is no rubbish here.</i></p>
<p><i>I bow to the Kinsman of the Sun, destroyer of the dart of craving.</i>” <span id="Endnote70">[<a href="#endnote70">70</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><h2>Devas’ Homage to the Buddha</h2></p>
<p>In the <i>Āṭānāṭiya Sutta</i> (DN:32), the Devas express their reverence to the Buddha:</p>
<p><b>“</b><i>They, having seen the Awakened One,</p>
<p>the Buddha, Kinsman of the Sun,</p>
<p>From afar, do reverence him,</p>
<p>who is great and fully mature.”</i></p>
<p><h1>More Epithets for the Buddha</h1></p>
<p>Throughout the scriptures and in tradition, we find numerous titles given to the Buddha by devas, his direct disciples, lay followers, and others who have recognized his great wisdom, universal compassion, boundless teaching skills, and supreme qualities.</p>
<p><h2>Mārisa— Venerable Sir or Lord <span id="Endnote71">[<a href="#endnote71">71</a>]</span></h2></p>
<p>According to scriptures the devas often addressed the Buddha as mārisa—venerable sir or Lord <span id="Endnote72">[<a href="#endnote72">72</a>]</span>.  The following quotes from the scriptures illustrate how devas would address the Blessed One:</p>
<p>“<i>kathaṃ nu tvaṃ, </i><b><i>mārisa</i></b><i>, oghamatarī’ti</i>?”  <span id="Endnote73">[<a href="#endnote73">73</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>(How, dear venerable, did you cross the flood?)</p>
<p>“<i>jānasi tho thvam</i> <b><i>mārisa</i></b><i>, sattānaṃ nimokkhaṃ pamokkhaṃ vivekaṃ?”</i></p>
<p>(Do you know, venerable sir, emancipation, release, seclusion for beings?” <span id="Endnote74">[<a href="#endnote74">74</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><h2>The Victor in Battle -Vijitasaṅgāmaṃ</h2></p>
<p>The Blessed One is referred as ‘the Victor in Battle’ because he has triumphed over Māra’s tenfold army. <span id="Endnote75">[<a href="#endnote75">75</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Venerable Vaṅgīsa addressed the Buddha as ‘the victor in battle<b> </b><span id="Endnote76">[<a href="#endnote76">76</a>]</span></p>
<p><i>“So, they attend on the victor in battle, </i></p>
<p><i>The unsurpassed caravan leader— </i></p>
<p><i>The disciples bearing the triple knowledge, </i></p>
<p><i>Who have left Death far behind”</i></p>
<p><h2>Sakka and Brahmā Sahampati’s Reverence</h2></p>
<p>Both <i>Sakka</i>, the lord of the Devas, and <i>Brahmā Sahampati</i> also referred to the Buddha as the “Victor in Battle”.<i> </i><span id="Endnote77">[<a href="#endnote77">77</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>“<i>Rise up, O hero, victor in battle!” </i><span id="Endnote78">[<a href="#endnote78">78</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>O caravan leader, debt-free one, wander in the world.</i></p>
<p><i>Teach the Dhamma, O Blessed One:There will be those who will understand” </i><span id="Endnote79">[<a href="#endnote79">79</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><h2>The Buddha’s Triumph Over Māra</h2></p>
<p>The following extract highlights how the Buddha became the Victor in Battle by defeating Māra. On one occasion, Māra approached the Blessed One, who was teaching in a large assembly, and said: <span id="Endnote80">[<a href="#endnote80">80</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>“Why now do you roar like a lion,</i></p>
<p><i>Confident in the assembly?</i></p>
<p><i>For there is one who’s a match for you,</i></p>
<p><i>So why think of yourself the victor?”</i></p>
<p>The Blessed One responded:</p>
<p><i>“The great heroes roar their lion’s roar</i></p>
<p><i>Confident in the assemblies—</i></p>
<p><i>The Tathāgatas endowed with the powers</i></p>
<p><i>Have crossed over attachment to the world</i>”<span id="Endnote81">[<a href="#endnote81">81</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><h2>The Caravan Leader- <i>satthāvāha</i></h2></p>
<p>The Blessed One is called <i>‘Caravan Leader’</i> because he leads beings across the desert of samsāra on the chariot of the Noble Eightfold Path. <span id="Endnote82">[<a href="#endnote82">82</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>In the following sutta, <i>Brahmā Sahampati</i> addresses the Buddha as the <i>Caravan Leader</i>:</p>
<p>“<i>Rise up, O hero, victor in battle! </i></p>
<p><i>O caravan leader, debt-free one, </i></p>
<p><i>wander in the world. Teach the Dhamma, </i></p>
<p><i>O Blessed One: </i></p>

<p><h2>Aṅgīrasa- The Resplendent One</h2></p>
<p><i>Aṅgīrasa</i> (Pali) means resplendent or glorious. This epithet refers to the Buddha, as he is pure, without defilements, and shines with radiant perfection—flawless in every way.<span id="Endnote85">[<a href="#endnote85">85</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>In Āṭānāṭiyasutta Sutta (DN:32), the King Vessavana, a Deva and other Devas pays homage to the Buddha calling him Aṅgīrasa:<span id="Endnote86">[<a href="#endnote86">86</a>]</span></p>

<p><h3>Venerable Vaṅgīsa’s Praise of the Buddha:</h3></p>
<p>Venerable Vaṅgīsa, a devoted disciple of the Blessed One, expressed his admiration in these luminous verses:</p>
<p><i>As the moon shines in a cloudless sky,</p>
<p>As the sun radiates without blemish,</p>
<p>So you, O Aṅgīrasa, O great sage,</p>
<p>Outshine the entire world with your glory.” </i><span id="Endnote88">[<a href="#endnote88">88</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>“As the moon shines in a cloudless sky, </i></p>
<p><i>As the sun shines devoid of stain, </i></p>
<p><i>So, you, Aṅgīrasa, O great sage, </i></p>
<p><i>Outshine the whole world with your glory”</i><span id="Endnote89">[<a href="#endnote89">89</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><h3>Candanaṅgalika’s Prasie</h3></p>
<p>In a dialogue with five kings, led by King Pasenadi of Kosala, the Buddha's radiant presence surpassed the kings in majesty. Witnessing this, <i>Candanaṅgalika</i>, a lay follower of the Blessed One, uttered this verse: <span id="Endnote90">[<a href="#endnote90">90</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>“As the fragrant red lotus Kokanada </i></p>
<p><i>Blooms in the morning, its fragrance unspent, </i></p>
<p><i>Behold Aṅgīrasa, the Radiant One, </i></p>
<p><i>Like the sun beaming in the sky.”</i> <span id="Endnote91">[<a href="#endnote91">91</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b><i>Note:</i></b> In the <i>Āmbattha Sutta</i> (DN), the Buddha mentions <i>Aṅgīrasa</i> as one of the ten ancient Brahmin sages, revered for their wisdom and for expounding the sacred mantras. These sages—Atthaka, Vamaka, Vamadeva, Vessamitta, Yamataggi, Aṅgīrasa, Bharadvaja, Vasettha, Kassapa, and Bhagu—are respected for their profound insight. <span id="Endnote92">[<a href="#endnote92">92</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><h1>Other Titles Bestowed Upon the Buddha</h1></p>
<p><h2>Great Ascetic (Māha Śramaṇa)</h2></p>
<p>The Buddha, having renounced his princely life to seek the ultimate truth, is often referred to as the <i>Great Ascetic</i> in the scriptures. His journey to enlightenment is an inspiration for all seekers of wisdom.</p>
<p><h3>Venerable Assaji spoke of the Buddha</h3></p>
<p><i>“There’s a great ascetic, a Sakyan who has gone forth from the Sakyan clan. I’ve gone forth in his name, he’s my teacher, and I follow his teaching.”</i> <span id="Endnote93">[<a href="#endnote93">93</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Uruvelā Kassapa,<b> a dreadlocked ascetic, addressed the Buddha with reverence:</b></p>
<p><i>“It’s not inconvenient for me, Great Ascetic, but there’s a fierce and highly venomous dragon king with supernormal powers there. I don’t want it to harm you.”</i><span id="Endnote94">[<a href="#endnote94">94</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Brahmin householders from Magadha,<b> </b>seeing the Buddha with Venerable Uruvelā Kassapa, marvelled:</p>
<p>“<i>Is the Great Ascetic practicing the spiritual life under Uruvelā Kassapa, or is Uruvelā Kassapa practicing the spiritual life under the Great Ascetic?”</i><span id="Endnote95">[<a href="#endnote95">95</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><h1>Titles Given to the Buddha by Devas</h1></p>
<p>One occasion revealed the Buddha's extraordinary endurance, when a stone splinter pierced his foot, causing intense bodily pain. Yet, he remained steadfast—mindful and composed, undisturbed by the discomfort. Witnessing this, a group of devas praised the Blessed One, offering these powerful epithets:</p>
<p><h2>Several Tittles Bequeathed to the Budha by Devas</h2></p>
<p>On one occasion the Buddha’s foot had been cut by a stone splinter. Severe pains</p>
<p>assailed the Blessed One—bodily feelings that were painful, racking, sharp, piercing, harrowing, disagreeable. But the Blessed One endured them, mindful and clearly comprehending, without becoming distressed. <span id="Endnote96">[<a href="#endnote96">96</a>]</span> Then a group of devas visited the Buddha, having seen him enduring bodily pain with mindfulness and equanimity the group devas praised the Blessed One thus: <span id="Endnote97">[<a href="#endnote97">97</a>]</span><b> </b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Nāga  (Elephant )<span id="Endnote98">[<a href="#endnote98">98</a>]</span><b> :</p>
<p></b><i>“The ascetic Gotama is indeed a nāga... He endures bodily pain—racking, sharp, and piercing—with the unwavering composure of a nāga, mindful and clearly comprehending, without distress.”   </i></p>

<p></b><i>“The ascetic Gotama is indeed a beast of burden... He carries the load of suffering with the grace and endurance of one who is unshaken.”</i></p>
<p></p>
<p>Danta (Tamed):<b> </b><span id="Endnote103">[<a href="#endnote103">103</a>]</span><b></p>
<p></b><b><i>“</i></b><i>The ascetic Gotama is indeed tamed... His mind, unperturbed by pain, remains serene and untarnished.”</i></p>
<p></p>
<p>Suvimuttaṃ (Well Liberated):<b></p>
<p></b><i>“The ascetic Gotama is well liberated: his samādhi is perfected, his mind unfettered—not bent forward or back, not blocked by forceful suppression.”</i></p>
<p><b><i>Note:</i></b> In the <i>Saṁyutta Nikāya</i> (SN:7), a deva named <i>Pañcālacaṇḍa</i> also praises the Buddha as the “chief bull” for his unshakable equanimity</p>
<p><h2>Numerous exalted titles</h2></p>
<p>In the <i>Upāli Sutta</i> (MN:56), the householder <i>Upāli</i> offers a profound homage to the Blessed One, addressing him with numerous exalted titles. Here is a glimpse of his praise: <span id="Endnote104">[<a href="#endnote104">104</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>“He is the Wise One who has cast off delusion,</p>
<p>Abandoned the wilderness of the heart, victorious in battle;</p>
<p>He knows no anguish, is perfectly even-minded,</p>
<p>Mature in virtue, of excellent wisdom;</p>
<p>Beyond all temptations, he is without stain:</p>
<p>The Blessed One is he, and I am his disciple”</i></p>
<p><i>(Dhīrassa vigatamohassa, pabhinnakhīlassa vijitavijayassa; Anīghassa susamacittassa, vuddhasīlassa sādhupaññassa</i><i> </i><i>Vesamantarassa, vimalassa, bhagavato tassa sāvakohamasmi) </i></p>
<p>This verse, rich in meaning, beautifully encapsulates the Buddha’s supreme qualities. Let us break down the honorifics used:</p>
<p></p>
<p>--	<b>Wise One (Dhīrassa): The Buddha is endowed with profound wisdom, a beacon of clarity and understanding.</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>--	<b>Cast off Delusion (Vigatamohassa): He has freed himself from the delusion that clouds the minds of all beings.</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>--	<b>Abandoned the Heart’s Wilderness (Pabhinnakhīlassa): The Buddha has transcended all worldly attachments and mental obstacles, leaving behind the wilderness of craving and ignorance.</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>--	<b>Victor in Battle (Vijitavijayassa): He triumphed over Māra’s tenfold army and attained the supreme victory of Buddhahood.</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>--	<b>He Knows No Anguish (Anīghassa): Free from suffering, the Buddha has overcome all forms of mental and physical pain.</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>--	<b>Perfectly Even-Minded (Susamacittassa): He embodies perfect equanimity, unshaken by the dualities of the world.</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>--	<b>Mature in Virtue (Vuddhasīlassa): The Buddha’s virtue is mature and flawless, a model of ethical conduct for all.</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>--	<b>Excellent Wisdom (Sādhupaññassa): His wisdom shines brilliantly, cutting through ignorance and illusion.</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>--	<b>Beyond All Temptations (Vesamantarassa): He has transcended all worldly defilements and temptations, standing firm in his purity.</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>--	<b>He is Without Stain (Vimalassa): The Buddha is pure, free from any stain or corruption of the heart and mind.</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>This is the end of this section. In the next section: Section:7 we will focus on the role of the Buddha as a supreme teacher of the world.</p>
