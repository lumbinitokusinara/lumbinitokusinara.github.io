          <p>With a heart full of reverence, we bow before you, O Blessed One, the incomparable Teacher, the Light of
            the world. Your boundless compassion, profound wisdom, and tireless service to humanity for forty-five years
            have illuminated the path of peace and liberation for countless beings.</p>
          <p>Through your unshakable patience and unwavering kindness, you revealed the noble truth of suffering and the
            way beyond it. You showed us that ignorance can be dispelled, craving can be abandoned, and suffering can be
            transcended. You gave not only words but also the perfect example—living a life of purity, simplicity, and
            complete selflessness, asking for nothing in return.</p>
          <p>Your Dhamma, like a cool stream, refreshes the weary and the lost, offering a refuge beyond all sorrow.
            Because of your compassionate effort, even now, over two and a half millennia later, your wisdom continues
            to guide those who seek the path of awakening.</p>
          <p>We humbly express our deepest gratitude, O Fully Enlightened One, for your supreme gift to the world. May
            we strive to walk the path you so graciously showed, with faith, diligence, and an open heart.</p>

          <h1>Introduction</h1>
          <p>This publication is a humble endeavour to present the life of the Buddha as recorded in the Pali
            Tripitaka—referred to here as the suttas or scriptures. Over the millennia, countless commentaries and
            folklore have enriched the narratives of the Buddha’s life, resulting in various versions being passed down
            across Buddhist traditions. However, this compilation seeks to return to the earliest accounts, drawing
            directly from the Pali Tipitaka—the very stories the Buddha himself shared about his childhood, his
            ministry, the people he encountered, and the journeys he undertook. From his birth in Lumbini to his final
            passing-away in Kusinara, this collection traces his extraordinary path, fittingly titled: "<b>From Lumbini
              to Kusinara – A Life Inspired: The Wonderful Journey of Our Gotama Buddha."</b></p>
          <p>Around 2,600 years ago, the Buddha delivered his first sermon—the Dhammacakkap -pavattana Sutta — at the
            Deer Park in Varanasi, India, to his former ascetic companions. That moment marked the turning of the Wheel
            of Dhamma, setting in motion a profound spiritual awakening. For the next forty-five years, he walked the
            lands of northern and eastern India, known in those times as Majjhimadesa (the Central Region of Dambadiva).
            He wandered through villages and cities, establishing a monastic order and sharing the timeless Dhamma with
            people from all walks of life.</p>
          <p>Born into royal privilege, the Buddha renounced a life of luxury in pursuit of truth, seeking the path to
            the complete cessation of suffering. Many who heard his teachings—both men and women—became his disciples,
            some even attaining the highest realization: Nibbāna.</p>
          <p>This compilation is an offering of gratitude for the priceless Dhamma—the Blessed One’s teachings, which
            continue to illuminate the path for countless beings. In this spirit, it is fitting to recall the words of
            Vidagama Maha Thero from the <i>Budugunaalankāraya</i>, which beautifully express the reverence one feels in
            making even the simplest offering to the Buddha:</p>
          <p><i>The Blessed One was honoured</p>
          <p>And revered with celestial coral flowers.</p>
          <p>I have only this humble work to offer to Him, the Great Sage.</p>
          <p>My gift is but a wildflower—</p>
          <p>Yet who can say it is unworthy?</i></p>
          <p>With the same humility and devotion, we present this work in homage to the Blessed One.</p>
          <p>May all beings be happy!</p>
          <p>May all beings attain Nibbāna!</p>
