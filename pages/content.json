    "Introduction": "<div class=\"container\">\n<article class=\"pagewidth\">\n<h1><b><i>Homage to the Buddha, the Perfected One, the fully Awakened One!!!</i></b></h1>\n<p><b>Introduction</b></p>\n<p>This publication is a humble endeavour to present the life of the Buddha as recorded in the Pali Tripitaka\u2014referred to here as the suttas or scriptures. Over the millennia, countless commentaries and folklore have enriched the narratives of the Buddha\u2019s life, resulting in various versions being passed down across Buddhist traditions. However, this compilation seeks to return to the earliest accounts, drawing directly from the Pali Tipitaka\u2014the very stories the Buddha himself shared about his childhood, his ministry, the people he encountered, and the journeys he undertook. From his birth in Lumbini to his final passing-away in Kusinara, this collection traces his extraordinary path, fittingly titled: \"<b>From Lumbini to Kusinara \u2013 A Life Inspired: The Wonderful Journey of Our Gotama Buddha.\"</b></p>\n<p>Around 2,600 years ago, the Buddha delivered his first sermon\u2014the Dhammacakkap -pavattana Sutta - at the Deer Park in Varanasi, India, to his former ascetic companions. That moment marked the turning of the Wheel of Dhamma, setting in motion a profound spiritual awakening. For the next forty-five years, he walked the lands of northern and eastern India, known in those times as Majjhimadesa (the Central Region of Dambadiva). He wandered through villages and cities, establishing a monastic order and sharing the timeless Dhamma with people from all walks of life.</p>\n<p>Born into royal privilege, the Buddha renounced a life of luxury in pursuit of truth, seeking the path to the complete cessation of suffering. Many who heard his teachings\u2014both men and women\u2014became his disciples, some even attaining the highest realization: Nibb\u0101na.</p>\n<p>This compilation is an offering of gratitude for the priceless Dhamma\u2014the Blessed One\u2019s teachings, which continue to illuminate the path for countless beings. In this spirit, it is fitting to recall the words of Vidagama Maha Thero from the <i>Budugunaalank\u0101raya</i>, which beautifully express the reverence one feels in making even the simplest offering to the Buddha:</p>\n<p><i>The Blessed One was honoured</p>\n<p>And revered with celestial coral flowers.</p>\n<p>I have only this humble work to offer to Him, the Great Sage.</p>\n<p>My gift is but a wildflower\u2014</p>\n<p>Yet who can say it is unworthy?</i></p>\n<p>With the same humility and devotion, we present this work in homage to the Blessed One.</p>\n<p>May all beings be happy!</p>\n<p>May all beings attain Nibb\u0101na!</p>\n<p>Compiled and edited by faithful followers of the Blessed One</p>\n<p>Santi Forest Monastery</p>\n<p>Vesak, 2025.</p>\n</article>\n</div>\n",

A Buddha does not arise by chance but through the boundless perfections (p\u0101ram\u012b) cultivated over countless lifetimes. His birth marks the culmination of an extraordinary journey, a moment when wisdom, compassion, and virtue manifest in their highest form for the welfare of all.</p>\n<p>In this section, we reflect upon the profound significance of the birth of the Bodhisatta, who would one day become the Supreme Teacher of gods and humans, the Buddha Gotama. While the Tipi\u1e6daka does not specify the exact year of his birth, the ancient traditions of Southeast Asia widely accept that he was born in 623 B.C. on the full moon day of May (Ves\u0101kha or Vesak)\u2014a day that remains sacred to millions who honour his life and teachings. ).<span id=\"Endnote1\">[<a href=\"#endnote1\">1</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Emerging into this world in the sacred grove of Lumbini, he took his first steps upon the earth, symbolizing the arrival of one who would walk the path of truth and guide others beyond suffering. From that blessed moment, his life unfolded as a beacon of wisdom, illuminating the northern lands of ancient India\u2014then known as Majjhimadesa (the Middle Country)\u2014where he would fulfill his great mission of awakening.<span id=\"Endnote2\">[<a href=\"#endnote2\">2</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The birth of a Buddha is not merely a historical event; it is a rare gift to the world, a cause for boundless rejoicing, for such a being arises solely out of infinite compassion to reveal the Dhamma\u2014the way to the highest peace, Nibb\u0101na.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page1/image1.jpeg\" />\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>Buddha in Sarnath Museum (Dhammajak Mutra) </b><span id=\"Endnote3\">[<a href=\"#endnote3\">3</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page1/image2.jpeg\" />\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>Map showing the Jambud\u020bpa during the time of Gotama Buddha </b><span id=\"Endnote4\">[<a href=\"#endnote4\">4</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>The Profound Significance of the Buddha\u2019s Birth</h2>\n<p>The birth of the Buddha is an event of unparalleled significance\u2014an extraordinary moment in the vast unfolding of time. The appearance of a Buddha in the human realm is a rare and wondrous occurrence, for he is an awakened being, a supreme teacher who illuminates the path from suffering and discontent to the ultimate freedom of Nibb\u0101na. His wisdom is a guiding light, his compassion boundless, and his teachings an enduring refuge for all who seek liberation.</p>\n<p>The scriptures speak of the immeasurable impact of such a being:</p>\n<p><i>\u201c\u2026There is one person who arises in the world for the welfare of many, for the happiness of many, out of compassion for the world, for the good, welfare, and happiness of devas and human beings\u2026 Who is that one person?

He does not merely teach the Dhamma\u2014he embodies it. With infinite patience, he reveals the path for those who wish to walk it, awakening countless beings to the truth.</p>\n<p>The birth of such a being is not just significant\u2014it is a cause for deep reverence and gratitude, for with him comes the opening of the door to the highest peace, the deathless, the unshakable liberation of Nibb\u0101na.</p>\n<p><b>Why is the Birth of the Buddha So Profoundly Significant?</b></p>\n<p>The birth of a Buddha is one of the rarest and most transformative events in the human realm. It is a moment of immense significance, for it heralds the arrival of an enlightened being\u2014one who has transcended all ignorance and suffering, who embodies boundless wisdom and compassion, and who dedicates his life to leading countless beings toward liberation.</p>\n<p>The Dhamma\u2014the sublime teachings revealed by the Buddha\u2014is an incomparable gift to the world, providing a guiding light for those seeking to transcend suffering and attain true peace. Without the appearance of a Buddha, the path to enlightenment remains hidden, lost to the world. It is only through the supreme realization of such an awakened being that the forgotten path is rediscovered, explained, and made accessible to all.</p>\n<p>In the cycle of birth and death, where beings wander endlessly through suffering, the emergence of a Buddha is an event of supreme rarity and immeasurable value. He is the one who, out of deep compassion, offers a way out of this endless cycle\u2014a way to Nibb\u0101na, the ultimate liberation. The Buddha\u2019s birth is not merely a historical occurrence; it is a cause for rejoicing among both devas and humans, for it signifies the opening of the doors to the Deathless.</p>\n<p>The scriptures express this truth with great reverence:</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026 There is one person who arises in the world</p>\n<p>for the welfare of many people,</p>\n<p>for the happiness of many people,</p>\n<p>out of compassion for the world,</p>\n<p>for the good, welfare, and happiness</p>\n<p>of devas and human beings \u2026</p>\n<p>Who is that one person?</p>\n<p>The Tath\u0101gata, the Arahant,</p>\n<p>the Perfectly Enlightened One\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>The birth of such a being is beyond measure in its significance. It is an event that reshapes the course of human history, bringing forth a timeless teaching that continues to inspire and guide beings even today. The Dhamma, proclaimed by the Buddha out of pure compassion, remains a beacon of wisdom, offering all who seek it a path toward freedom, peace, and the highest happiness.</p>\n<p>Thus, when a Buddha is born, the world is blessed beyond words. The great darkness of delusion is dispelled, and the radiant light of truth shines forth once more, illuminating the way to the highest goal\u2014Nibb\u0101na.</p>\n<p><b><u>The Buddha descending to this world</u></b></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026and on Lord Buddha, waiting in that sky,</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Came for our sakes the five sure signs of birth</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>So that the Devas knew the signs, and spoke</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201d Buddha will go again to help the World.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201d Yea!\u201d spoke He, \u201cnow I go to help the World</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This last of many times; for birth and death</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>End hence for me and those who learn my Law.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I will go down among the S\u0101kyas,</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Under the southward snows of Himalay,</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Where pious people live and a just King.\u201d <span id=\"Endnote6\">[<a href=\"#endnote6\">6</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>The Bodhisatta Descends from the Tu\u1e63ita Deva Realm</h2>\n<p>According to Buddhist scriptures, the Buddha was born in a human realm as a Bodhisatta <span id=\"Endnote7\">[<a href=\"#endnote7\">7</a>]</span>,  having spent a period of time in the \u201cdeva\u201d realm of Tu\u1e63ita\u2019 <span id=\"Endnote8\">[<a href=\"#endnote8\">8</a>]</span>.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page1/image3.jpeg\" />\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>Bodhisatta in Tu\u1e63ita Heaven </b><span id=\"Endnote9\">[<a href=\"#endnote9\">9</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>Venerable \u0100nanda</b> <span id=\"Endnote10\">[<a href=\"#endnote10\">10</a>]</span> is quoted in the suttas, describing the birth of the Buddha:</p>\n<p><i>\u201c\u2026I heard and learned this, Venerable Sir, from the Blessed One\u2019s own lips: \u2018Mindful and fully aware\u2026the Bodhisatta appeared in the Tusita heaven \u2026the Bodhisatta remained in the Tusita heaven \u2026the Bodhisatta passed away from the Tusita heaven\u201d and descended into his mother\u2019s womb\u201d</i> <span id=\"Endnote11\">[<a href=\"#endnote11\">11</a>]</span></p>\n<h2>The Bodhisatta\u2019s Birth into a Royal Family</h2>\n<p>The Bodhisatta was born into the noble Sakyan dynasty, a lineage of warrior-kings known for their wisdom and strength.

That night, the queen experienced a dream of profound significance\u2014one that foretold the arrival of an extraordinary being who would change the course of history.</p>\n<h3>Queen Mah\u0101m\u0101y\u0101\u2019s Dream</h3>\n<p>On a radiant full-moon night, as Queen Mah\u0101m\u0101y\u0101 lay asleep in the palace, she had a vivid and wondrous dream. She felt herself being gently lifted by four celestial beings and carried to Lake Anotatta, a sacred and pristine lake nestled in the Himalayas. There, the devas bathed her in the pure waters, adorned her in divine garments, anointed her with fragrant perfumes, and decorated her with heavenly flowers.</p>\n<p>As she rested in this sublime state, a magnificent white elephant appeared before her, holding a pure white lotus in its trunk. With grace and majesty, the elephant circled her three times before entering her womb through her right side. <span id=\"Endnote12\">[<a href=\"#endnote12\">12</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This sacred vision was a divine omen, signifying that the child she carried was no ordinary being.

Both monks embarked on long pilgrimages from China to India, visiting ancient Buddhist sites along the way.</p>\n<p>These two distinguished travellers from the Far East not only visited Lumbini, but also many other important Buddhist locations. Their detailed travel records, documenting their experiences, later became invaluable to archaeologists and scholars in identifying the Buddha\u2019s birthplace, as well as other key Buddhist sites. <span id=\"Endnote36\">[<a href=\"#endnote36\">36</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page1/image13.jpeg\" />\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>Ancient ruins at Lumbini, Nepal </b><span id=\"Endnote37\">[<a href=\"#endnote37\">37</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page1/image14.jpeg\" />\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>World Peace Pagoda in Lumbini </b><span id=\"Endnote38\">[<a href=\"#endnote38\">38</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>The Buddha: A Noble Sage of the Sakyan Clan</h2>\n<p>Throughout the scriptures, the Buddha is revered as a member of the noble Sakyan clan, which is why he came to be known as \u2018Sakya Muni\u2019, the sage of the Sakyans, and his disciples as \u2018Sakya Putta\u2019, the sons of the Sakyans. The Sakyan Republic was located on the edge of the majestic Himalayas, with Kapilavattu serving as their royal capital. Though the Sakyan Republic was under the rule of the King of Kosala, it was a republican state, where power was shared among its leaders.</p>\n<p>According to both tradition and the scriptures, King Okk\u0101ka was regarded as the legendary ancestor of the Sakyans. The Amba\u1e6d\u1e6dha Sutta (DN:3) recounts a passage that highlights the origins of the Sakyan clan in these words:</p>\n<p>The Buddha said:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cThe Sakyans regard King Okk\u0101ka as their revered ancestor. Once, King Okk\u0101ka, who cherished his beloved queen, wished to transfer the kingdom to her son. To do so, he exiled his elder brothers, who took residence at the foothills of the Himalayas, beside a lotus-pond and a grand grove of teak trees\u201d</i></p>\n<p>When King Okk\u0101ka inquired about his sons' whereabouts, his ministers informed him of their location. Upon hearing this, the king declared:</p>\n<p><b><i>\u2018</i></b><i>They are strong as teak (s\u0101ka), these princes, they are true Sakyans!\u2019 And it is from this strength and resilience, like the teak tree, that the Sakyans derived their name. King Okk\u0101ka was their forefather, and from him, the noble line of the Sakyans continues.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>Thus, the Buddha\u2019s lineage is not only one of noble birth but also one of profound wisdom and strength, rooted in the strength of the teak trees and the enduring legacy of his ancestors. The Sakyan clan was marked by qualities of resilience and nobility, and it was from this noble lineage that the Sakyamuni arose, destined to awaken and share the path to liberation with all beings.</p>\n<p>The Sakyans (also called Khattiya) were rulers, and they were known for their proud and noble nature. During the time of the Buddha, society was divided into four main classes: Brahmins, who served as priests and scholars; Kshatriyas, who were warriors, kings, and rulers; Vaishyas, who were merchants and traders; and Shudras, who were labourers and servants. The Sakyans, as part of the Kshatriya class, were regarded with a sense of pride and strength. Some of the attributes of the Khattiya class are expressed in the following verses:</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>The Khattiya is the highest among people, </i></p>\n<p><i>for those who measure by lineage and honour...\u201d</i> <span id=\"Endnote39\">[<a href=\"#endnote39\">39</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201c<i>The aim of the Khattiyas is wisdom; </i></p>\n<p><i>their foundation is power. Their ambition is for territory, </i></p>\n<p><i>and their ultimate goal is sovereignty</i>.\u201d <span id=\"Endnote40\">[<a href=\"#endnote40\">40</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Thus, the Sakyans embodied the qualities of leadership, ambition, and a deep pursuit of wisdom, standing proudly as rulers of their land and people.</p>\n<h2>Kapilavattu the Royal City of the Sakyan</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>Tradition holds that the city of Kapilavattu was named in honor of the great sage Kapila. According to the legend, when the exiled princes of King Okk\u0101ka ventured into the Himalayan range in search of a place to settle, they came upon the hermitage of Sage Kapila, who welcomed them with kindness and offered them refuge. Grateful for his assistance, the princes later established a city and named it Kapilavattu as a tribute to the sage who had helped them.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In the Mah\u0101pad\u0101na Sutta (DN:14), there is a passage where the devas refer to Kapilavattu as the birthplace of the Buddha:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\u201c\u2026In this fortunate aeon, the Lord Buddha has arisen in the world\u2026 His father is King Suddhodana, his mother was Queen Maya, and his royal capital is Kapilavattu\u2026\u201d</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Further, in the Mah\u0101parinibb\u0101na Sutta (DN:16), when the Buddha passed away, the Sakyans of Kapilavattu sent a request for his relics, as they considered themselves the rightful heirs of the Buddha\u2019s legacy:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\u201c\u2026The Sakyas of Kapilavattu heard of the Buddha\u2019s passing, and they sent a message saying: \u2018The Lord was the chief of our clan.

As the capital of the Sakyan clan, it was a bustling, prosperous city with a rich cultural and political significance. Mah\u0101n\u0101ma, a prominent member of the Sakyan clan, described the city\u2019s vibrant nature in this way:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\u201cThis Kapilavattu is rich and prosperous, populous and crowded, with its thoroughfares congested.

The following excerpts from the scriptures highlight the central purpose of the Buddha's presence in the world.</p>\n<h3>The Buddha\u2019s Message of Suffering and Liberation</h3>\n<p>The Buddha understood deeply the immense suffering caused by birth, old age, sickness, and death. He wanted humanity to recognize that suffering is an inescapable part of life. He proclaimed:</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Bhikkhus, if these three things\u2014</i><b><i>birth, old age, and death</i></b><i>\u2014did not exist in the world, the Tath\u0101gata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One would not arise, and the Dhamma he teaches would not shine in the world\u2026\u201d</i><span id=\"Endnote8\">[<a href=\"#endnote8\">8</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>The Path to Overcome Suffering</h2>\n<p>But the Buddha did not leave humanity without hope.

His deep concern for the suffering of the world motivated him to share the path of liberation. The following passage illustrates how his kindness and compassion led him to teach:</p>\n<p>\u201c The Tathagata, awakened, who endured what is hard to endure, two thoughts occur: safety the first thought mentioned;\u00a0seclusion the second\u2026 he dispeller of darkness, free of fermentation, the great seer who has gone beyond, reached attainment, gained mastery crossed over the poisons; who's released in the ending of craving: that sage bears his last body, has shaken off M\u0101ra, I tell you, has gone beyond aging. As one standing on a rocky crag would see the people all around below, so the wise, with the all-around eye having scaled the tower made of Dhamma, having crossed over sorrow, gaze on those overwhelmed with sorrow, conquered by aging and death.\u201d <span id=\"Endnote14\">[<a href=\"#endnote14\">14</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Standing high on a rocky mountain \u2013</p>\n<p>you can see the people all around.</p>\n<p>In the same way, the all-seer, so wise-</p>\n<p>having ascended the Temple of Truth,</p>\n<p>Rid of sorrow, looks upon the people-</p>\n<p>Swamped with sorrow, oppressed by aging and death.<span id=\"Endnote15\">[<a href=\"#endnote15\">15</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Buddha, having attained enlightenment, saw the suffering of all beings and, moved by boundless compassion, shared his wisdom to guide them towards the cessation of suffering.</p>\n<h1>The Buddha Acts Like a Skilful Surgeon</h1>\n<p>In the <i>Sunakkhatta Sutta</i> (MN:105), the Blessed One compares himself to a skilful surgeon. Just as a surgeon uses a knife to remove poison from a wound caused by an arrow, the Buddha, as a spiritual surgeon, removes the poison of craving from the minds of others. In this simile, the arrow represents craving, the poison symbolizes ignorance (not knowing the Four Noble Truths), the knife represents Noble Wisdom, and the surgeon is the Buddha, the Fully Enlightened One. With great compassion, the Buddha, having seen the suffering of beings, steps forward to relieve them from the pain and misery of Samsara.</p>\n<p>The Buddha said:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cSuppose, Sunakkhatta, a man is wounded by an arrow smeared with poison. The surgeon would cut around the wound with a knife, then use a probe to locate the arrow. After removing the arrow, the surgeon would expel the poisonous substance, leaving only a trace of it behind. </i></p>\n<p><i>He would then say: \u2018Good man, the arrow has been removed, and the poison has been expelled, leaving no trace to harm you. Eat only suitable food, wash the wound regularly, and anoint its opening to prevent pus and blood from covering it. Take care of the wound, and ensure it heals properly.\u2019</i></p>\n<p><i>\u201cIt is possible, Sunakkhatta, that a bhikkhu here might reflect: \u2018</i><b><i>Craving has been compared to an arrow by the Recluse; the poisonous substance of ignorance is spread by desire, lust, and ill will.</i></b><i> That arrow of craving has been removed from me, and the poisonous substance of ignorance has been expelled. I am fully intent on Nibb\u0101na.\u2019 A person truly intent on Nibb\u0101na would not pursue things unsuitable for one on the path to Nibb\u0101na. Because they do not pursue unsuitable things, lust would not invade their mind. And because their mind is free from lust, they would not encounter death or suffering.\u201d</i><span id=\"Endnote16\">[<a href=\"#endnote16\">16</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>People Delight to Hear the Dhamma</h1>\n<p>When the Buddha, with his boundless wisdom and infinite compassion, teaches the Dhamma, his words resonate deeply with all who listen. It is said that four extraordinary things unfold when the Tath\u0101gata speaks: People, who are often caught in the web of attachment, conceit, excitement, and ignorance, find themselves drawn to his teachings. As the Buddha reveals the path to freedom from these very burdens, hearts are awakened, and listeners eagerly open their minds, seeking understanding. In the presence of the Tath\u0101gata\u2019s words, they delight in the wisdom that leads to liberation, finding joy in the removal of their afflictions and the blossoming of true insight.<i> \u201d</i><span id=\"Endnote17\">[<a href=\"#endnote17\">17</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Dhamma has One Taste: The Taste of Liberation</p>\n<p>The Blessed One taught the Dhamma for the liberation of beings. Just as the vast ocean has but one taste\u2014salt\u2014the Dhamma too has one taste: the taste of liberation, the deliverance from suffering. As the Buddha proclaimed:</p>\n<p><i>\u201c\u2026</i><b><i>this Dhamma and discipline has but one taste, the taste of liberation.</i></b><i>\u201d</i><span id=\"Endnote18\">[<a href=\"#endnote18\">18</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Path to Liberation: Understanding the Four Noble Truths</p>\n<p>The Four Noble Truths, revealed by the Blessed One on the night of his enlightenment, are the very heart of his teaching. These truths illuminate the path to liberation, guiding us out of the depths of suffering and into the light of freedom. The Dhamma, like a sweet and nourishing fruit, offers us the taste of liberation, a freedom that transcends all worldly pain.</p>\n<p>When we wholeheartedly embrace and follow the path laid out by the Buddha, we are assured of the ultimate goal\u2014freedom from suffering.</p>\n<p>In essence, the Four Noble Truths are: <span id=\"Endnote19\">[<a href=\"#endnote19\">19</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1)\tThere is suffering in this world,</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2)\tIt arises from craving,</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>3)\tWhen craving is abandoned, suffering ceases,</p>\n<p>4.   The way to freedom is through the Noble Eightfold Path. <span id=\"Endnote20\">[<a href=\"#endnote20\">20</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>By understanding and practicing these truths, we are set on a journey to lasting peace and liberation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Importance of Understanding the Four Noble Truths</p>\n<p>In the <i>Mah\u0101parinibb\u0101na Sutta</i> (DN:16), the Blessed One emphasized the profound significance of understanding the Four Noble Truths. He said:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026It is through not understanding, not penetrating the Four Noble Truths that both I and you have long wandered through the cycle of birth and death. But through understanding and penetrating these same truths, the craving for becoming is cut off, the root of becoming is destroyed, and there is no more rebirth.\u201d</p>\n<p><i>\u201cNot seeing the Four Noble Truths as they are,</p>\n<p>Having long traversed the round from life to life,</p>\n<p>These being seen, becoming\u2019s supports pulled up,</p>\n<p>Sorrow\u2019s root cut off; rebirth is done.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Bhikkhu, not knowing suffering, not knowing the origin of suffering, not knowing the cessation of suffering, not knowing the way leading to the cessation of suffering: this is called ignorance, bhikkhu, and it is in this way that one is immersed in ignorance\u201d</i><span id=\"Endnote21\">[<a href=\"#endnote21\">21</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Venerable S\u0101riputta further highlighted the importance of these truths with the following simile:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cFriends, just as the footprint of any living being that walks can fit within the footprint of an elephant, and the elephant\u2019s footprint is considered the largest and most significant, so too, all wholesome states can be included within the Four Noble Truths.\u201d</i><span id=\"Endnote22\">[<a href=\"#endnote22\">22</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In these teachings, the Buddha and his disciples underscored that understanding the Four Noble Truths is not just important\u2014it is essential for the cessation of suffering and the attainment of liberation. All paths to wisdom and freedom are contained within them.</p>\n<h3>Knowing the Four Noble Truths: The Foundation of the Holy Life</h3>\n<p>The Buddha instructed the Sangha on the essential practice of reflecting on the Four Noble Truths:</p>\n<p><i>\"Bhikkhus, when you reflect, you should contemplate: \u2018This is suffering\u2019; \u2018This is the origin of suffering\u2019; \u2018This is the cessation of suffering\u2019; \u2018This is the path leading to the cessation of suffering.\u2019 Why is this important? Because such reflection is beneficial, fundamental to the holy life, and leads to disenchantment, to detachment, to cessation, to peace, to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, and ultimately to Nibb\u0101na.\u201d </i><span id=\"Endnote23\">[<a href=\"#endnote23\">23</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Understanding and contemplating the Four Noble Truths is the very essence of the spiritual path, guiding one toward ultimate liberation.</p>\n<h3>Realizing the Four Noble Truths: The Path to Nibb\u0101na</h3>\n<p>Attaining Nibb\u0101na is only possible through the direct realization of the Four Noble Truths. The following sutta emphasizes this profound truth:</p>\n<p><b><i>\"</i></b><i>Bhikkhus, all ascetics and brahmins in the past who fully awakened to reality did so by realizing the Four Noble Truths as they truly are. All ascetics and brahmins in the future who will fully awaken to reality will do so by realizing the Four Noble Truths as they truly are.

Known as the <i>Middle Way</i>, it is the noble path that transcends extremes and fulfills the highest purpose of life\u2014the complete liberation from the endless cycle of suffering in <i>Sa\u1e43s\u0101ra</i>.</p>\n<p>In his first discourse, the Blessed One expounded this profound path with these words: <span id=\"Endnote25\">[<a href=\"#endnote25\">25</a>]</span></p>\n<p><i>\"And what, bhikkhus, is that middle way, realized by the Tath\u0101gata, which gives rise to vision, which leads to peace, to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibb\u0101na?

The Buddha himself affirmed this in the following words:</p>\n<p><i>\"Bhikkhus, I have seen the ancient path, the ancient road traversed by the Perfectly Enlightened Ones of the past. And what is that ancient path, that ancient road? It is none other than this Noble Eightfold Path...

Once, when Venerable \u0100nanda asked the Blessed One to reveal a divine vehicle within this Dhamma and Discipline, the</p>\n<p>Buddha proclaimed:</p>\n<p><i>\u201c\u2026this Noble Eightfold Path is known as \u2018the divine vehicle,\u2019 \u2018the vehicle of Dhamma,\u2019 and \u2018the unsurpassed victory in battle.\u201d </i><span id=\"Endnote28\">[<a href=\"#endnote28\">28</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Buddha then described this path as a majestic chariot, perfectly equipped for the journey to liberation:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cIts qualities of faith and wisdom</i></p>\n<p><i>Are always yoked evenly together.</i></p>\n<p><i>Shame is its pole, mind its yoke-tie,</i></p>\n<p><i>Mindfulness the watchful charioteer.</i></p>\n<p><i>The chariot\u2019s ornament is virtue,</i></p>\n<p><i>Its axle jh\u0101na, energy its wheels;</i></p>\n<p><i>Equanimity keeps the burden balanced,</i></p>\n<p><i>Desirelessness serves as upholstery.</i></p>\n<p><i>Good will, harmlessness, and seclusion:</i></p>\n<p><i>These are the chariot\u2019s weaponry,</i></p>\n<p><i>Forbearance its armour and shield,</i></p>\n<p><i>As it rolls towards security from bondage.</i></p>\n<p><i>This divine vehicle unsurpassed</i></p>\n<p><i>Originates from within oneself.</i></p>\n<p><i>The wise depart from the world in it,</i></p>\n<p><i>Inevitably winning the victory.\u201d </i><span id=\"Endnote29\">[<a href=\"#endnote29\">29</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>The Noble Eightfold Path is the chariot of wisdom, powered by virtue and mindfulness, rolling steadily toward Nibb\u0101na.

In response, the Buddha revealed the path that leads beyond all distractions and delusions:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cThe straightway\u2014that is its name,</i></p>\n<p><i>And \u2018fearless\u2019 is its destination.</i></p>\n<p><i>The chariot is called \u2018unrattling,\u2019</i></p>\n<p><i>Fitted with wheels of wholesome states.</i></p>\n<p><i>A sense of shame is its leaning board,</i></p>\n<p><i>Mindfulness its upholstery;</i></p>\n<p><i>I call the Dhamma the charioteer,</i></p>\n<p><i>With right view running out in front.</i></p>\n<p><b><i>Whoever travels in such a vehicle\u2014</i></b><b></p>\n<p></b><b><i>Whether woman or man</i></b><i>\u2014</i></p>\n<p><i>Will, by means of this noble path,</i></p>\n<p><i>Draw ever closer to Nibb\u0101na.\u201d </i><span id=\"Endnote30\">[<a href=\"#endnote30\">30</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>The Noble Eightfold Path is the unwavering road to liberation, the fearless way that leads beyond all suffering.

The Dhamma teaches that beings are bound to be reborn again and again due to their cravings and attachments. The ultimate purpose of the Buddha\u2019s teaching is not only to guide beings toward restraint in this life but also to help them break free from the endless cycle of birth, aging, and death.</p>\n<p>The Buddha emphasized that true wisdom lies in seeing the dangers of continued existence and striving for the cessation of rebirth:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cCunda, I do not teach you a Dhamma for restraining the corruptions that arise in the present life alone. I do not teach a Dhamma merely for their destruction in future lives, but one for their restraining in this life as well as for their destruction in future lives\u2026\u201d </i><span id=\"Endnote31\">[<a href=\"#endnote31\">31</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>By cultivating wisdom, virtue, and meditative insight, one gradually weakens the forces that perpetuate rebirth.

Instead, his mind becomes steady and aligned with the Dhamma. A noble disciple with a steady mind gains inspiration in the meaning, inspiration in the Dhamma, and joy connected with the Dhamma. With the arising of joy, rapture follows. For one experiencing rapture, the body becomes tranquil. With a tranquil body, one feels pleasure. And for one experiencing pleasure, the mind becomes unified (sam\u0101dhi).\u201d<span id=\"Endnote35\">[<a href=\"#endnote35\">35</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Buddhist pay homage to the Dhamma by reflecting the <b>six qualities of the Dhamma</b>:</p>\n<p><i>sv\u0101kkh\u0101to bhagavat\u0101 dhammo sandi\u1e6d\u1e6dhiko, ak\u0101liko, ehipassiko, opanayiko Paccatta\u1e43 veditabbo vi\u00f1\u00f1\u016bhiti </i></p>\n<p>1) well expounded-explained (svakkhato) 2) directly visible-can be experienced in this life</p>\n<p>( sanditthiko) 3) gives immediate results (akaliko) 4)  invites people to come and see (ehipassiko-)  5) applicable- every step takes towards liberation (opanayiko) 6) to be personally experienced by the wise (paccattam veditabbo vinnuhiti)</p>\n<h2>Eight Astounding and Remarkable Qualities of the Dhamma</h2>\n<p>The Buddha described eight extraordinary qualities of this Dhamma that bring delight to his followers: <span id=\"Endnote36\">[<a href=\"#endnote36\">36</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1)\tJust as the great ocean gradually slopes, inclines, and deepens without sudden drops, so too, in this Dhamma and discipline, the attainment of final knowledge occurs through gradual training, gradual practice, and gradual progress\u2014not abruptly.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2)\tJust as the great ocean remains stable and never overflows its boundaries, so too, when the Buddha has established a training rule for his disciples, they do not transgress it, even at the cost of their lives.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>3)\tJust as the great ocean does not tolerate a corpse but swiftly carries it to the shore and washes it away, so too, the Sa\u1e45gha does not associate with those who are immoral, of bad character, or engaged in corrupt conduct. Such a person is swiftly removed, and even if seated among the Sa\u1e45gha, he is far from it, and the Sa\u1e45gha is far from him.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>4)\tJust as the great rivers lose their former names and identities when they merge into the great ocean, so too, when individuals from the four social classes\u2014khattiyas, brahmins, vessas, and suddas\u2014renounce the household life and enter the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tath\u0101gata, they abandon their previous names and social distinctions and are simply known as ascetics following the Sakyan son.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>5)\tJust as no matter how many streams flow into the great ocean or how much rain falls upon it, no decrease or filling up can be observed, so too, even if countless bhikkhus attain final Nibb\u0101na in the nibb\u0101na element without residue, there is neither depletion nor increase in the Nibb\u0101na element.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>6)\tJust as the great ocean has only one taste\u2014the taste of salt\u2014so too, this Dhamma and discipline has only one taste: the taste of liberation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>7)\tJust as the great ocean contains numerous precious treasures\u2014such as pearls, gems, and rare substances\u2014so too, this Dhamma and discipline is abundant with treasures of wisdom, including the four establishments of mindfulness, the four right efforts, the four bases of spiritual power, the five faculties, the five strengths, the seven factors of enlightenment, and the noble eightfold path.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>8)\tJust as the great ocean is home to mighty beings\u2014creatures with bodies extending for hundreds or even five hundred yojanas\u2014so too, this Dhamma and discipline is the dwelling place of great beings: the stream-enterer, the one practicing for the fruit of stream-entry; the once-returner, the one practicing for the fruit of once-returning; the non-returner, the one practicing for the fruit of non-returning; and the arahant, the one striving for full liberation.</p>\n<h2>The Dhamma is Directly Visible (Sandi\u1e6d\u1e6dhiko Dhammo)</h2>\n<p>This is yet another marvellous quality of the Dhamma. When one follows the Dhamma, one knows for oneself that it is being practiced as the Buddha taught.</p>\n<p>When people asked how the Dhamma is directly visible, the Blessed One explained:</p>\n<p><i>\u201c\u2026When there is lust, hatred, delusion, or any bodily, verbal, or mental misconduct within you, you know: \u2018There is lust, hatred, and delusion within me.\u2019 And when there is no lust, hatred, or delusion within you, you know: \u2018There is no lust, hatred, or delusion within me.\u2019</i></p>\n<p><i>In this way, the Dhamma is directly visible, immediate, inviting one to come and see, applicable, and to be personally experienced by the wise.\u201d </i><span id=\"Endnote37\">[<a href=\"#endnote37\">37</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>The Path to Learning and Practicing the Dhamma</h1>\n<p>Training in and learning the Dhamma is a continuous process. The culmination of this training is liberation\u2014the attainment of final knowledge and the realization of noble attainment as an Arahant. The Buddha often described learning and practicing the Dhamma as a gradual process. The following passages from the suttas illustrate this principle:</p>\n<h2>Gradual Training</h2>\n<p>The Buddha emphasized that final knowledge is not attained instantly but unfolds step by step through dedicated practice:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cBhikkhus, I do not say that final knowledge is attained all at once. On the contrary, it is achieved through gradual training, gradual practice, and gradual progress.\u201d</i><span id=\"Endnote38\">[<a href=\"#endnote38\">38</a>]</span><i></p>\n<p></i></p>\n<h2>Gradual Practice</h2>\n<p>The following passage outlines the step-by-step progression of training in the Dhamma:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cAnd how is final knowledge attained through gradual training, gradual practice, and gradual progress?</i><span id=\"Endnote39\">[<a href=\"#endnote39\">39</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Here, one who has <b>faith</b> in a teacher seeks him out. Upon <b>visiting </b>him, he pays <b>respect</b>; in showing respect, he <b>listens attentively</b>. By listening, he <b>hears the Dhamma</b>; having heard the Dhamma, he <b>memorizes</b> it. He then <b>examines</b> the meaning of the teachings he has memorized. Through examination, he gains a <b>reflective acceptance</b> of those teachings. When this reflective acceptance arises, <b>zeal springs up</b>. With zeal, <b>he applies his will</b>. Applying his will, he <b>scrutinizes the Dhamma</b>. With scrutiny, he <b>strives diligently</b>. Through resolute striving, he <b>realizes </b>with his own body the supreme truth and sees it by penetrating it with wisdom.\u201d<span id=\"Endnote40\">[<a href=\"#endnote40\">40</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2> Gradual Learning</h2>\n<p>In the Cank\u012b Sutta (MN:85), the Blessed One elaborates on the gradual process of learning and training in the Dhamma, culminating in liberation. The key stages are summarized as follows:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1)\tFirst, one must establish faith in the Dhamma, which requires finding a suitable teacher.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2)\tWith faith in the teacher, one visits him.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>3)\tUpon visiting the teacher, one pays respect.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>4)\tThrough respect, one develops attentiveness to the teacher\u2019s words.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>5)\tBy attentively listening, one hears the Dhamma.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>6)\tHaving heard the Dhamma, one memorizes it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>7)\tOne then examines the meaning of the teachings.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>8)\tThrough examination, one gains a reflective acceptance of the teachings.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>9)\tWith reflective acceptance, zeal arises.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>10)\tWith zeal, one applies effort and willpower.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>11)\tWith applied effort, one scrutinizes the Dhamma.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>12)\tThrough scrutiny, one strives for realization.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>13)\tThrough resolute striving, one directly realizes the supreme truth, seeing it through the penetration of wisdom.</p>\n<p>This structured approach underscores the importance of persistence, dedication, and step-by-step cultivation in the journey toward liberation.</p>\n<h1>A Disciple\u2019s Journey in Learning the Dhamma</h1>\n<p>The path of learning and training in the Dhamma is one of dedication, perseverance, and deep reflection. In the following sutta, Venerable \u0100nanda beautifully describes the process of mastering the Dhamma as he understood it from the Buddha\u2019s teaching: <span id=\"Endnote41\">[<a href=\"#endnote41\">41</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1)\tA bhikkhu first learns the Dhamma\u2014comprising discourses, mixed prose and verse, expositions, verses, inspired utterances, quotations, birth stories, profound accounts, and questions-and-answers.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2)\tHe shares the Dhamma with others, teaching it in detail just as he has heard and learned it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>3)\tHe encourages others to recite the Dhamma, ensuring they learn it thoroughly and preserve its purity.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>4)\tHe himself regularly recites the Dhamma with precision, deepening his understanding.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>5)\tHe reflects upon the Dhamma, examines its meaning, and contemplates it deeply as he has heard and learned it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>6)\tDuring the rains retreat, he resides in a monastery where learned elder bhikkhus dwell\u2014those who are well-versed in the teachings, heirs to the noble heritage, experts in the Dhamma, the discipline, and the deeper principles. From time to time, he approaches them with humility and asks: <b>\u201cBhante, how is this? What is the meaning of this?\u201d</b></p>\n<p>The venerable ones then reveal to him what was previously unclear, illuminate what was obscure, and dispel his doubts about intricate aspects of the teaching. Through this sincere inquiry and guidance:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\tHe hears teachings he had not heard before.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\tHe does not forget the teachings he has already learned.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\tHe recalls and contemplates familiar teachings.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\tHe gains deeper insight into what he had not previously understood.</p>\n<p><b>Thus, a disciple walks the noble path of learning, not merely accumulating knowledge but cultivating wisdom, deepening faith, and moving ever closer to liberation.</b></p>\n<h2>The Importance of Reciting the Dhamma</h2>\n<p>Recitation plays a vital role in learning and training in the Dhamma. It ensures the preservation, understanding, and transmission of the teachings. The Buddha emphasized this by saying:</p>\n<p><i>\u201c\u2026Cunda, all of you to whom I have taught these truths, realized through super knowledge, should come together and recite them\u2014aligning meaning with meaning and expression with expression\u2014without discord. In doing so, this holy life will endure and remain firmly established for a long time, for the benefit and happiness of the many, out of compassion for the world, and for the welfare, benefit, and happiness of both devas and humans\u2026\u201d</i><span id=\"Endnote42\">[<a href=\"#endnote42\">42</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The things that should be recited are the 37 factors of enlightenment.  <span id=\"Endnote43\">[<a href=\"#endnote43\">43</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Through diligent recitation, the Dhamma is safeguarded, enabling future generations to walk the noble path toward liberation.</p>\n<h1>Understanding the True Goodness of the Dhamma</h1>\n<p>To walk the noble path and fulfill the spiritual life, one must clearly distinguish between the true Dhamma (Dhamma-truth) and what is not Dhamma (adhamma). Recognizing this difference is essential for one\u2019s progress toward liberation.</p>\n<p>Thus, the Buddha proclaimed:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cBhikkhus, what is non-Dhamma and harmful should be understood, and what is the Dhamma and beneficial should also be understood\u2026 And what, bhikkhus, is the Dhamma and beneficial?\u201d </i><span id=\"Endnote44\">[<a href=\"#endnote44\">44</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It is:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\tRight View,</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\tRight Intention,</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\tRight Speech,</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\tRight Action,</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\tRight Livelihood,</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\tRight Effort,</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\tRight Mindfulness,</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\tRight Samadhi</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\tRight Knowledge,</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\tand Right Liberation.\u201d</p>\n<p>By cultivating and embracing these ten qualities, one walks firmly on the path of truth, dispelling ignorance, and illuminating the way to ultimate freedom. The true Dhamma is not merely to be known\u2014it is to be realized, lived, and embodied in every thought, word, and action. \u201d<span id=\"Endnote45\">[<a href=\"#endnote45\">45</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Wrong View Is Not the Dhamma</h2>\n<p>The Blessed One clearly taught that non-Dhamma is the direct opposite of the Dhamma. Venerable \u0100nanda later explained this profound truth to the Sa\u1e45gha:</p>\n<p><i>\u201c\u2026Friends, wrong view is non-Dhamma, while right view is the Dhamma. The numerous harmful and unwholesome qualities that arise due to wrong view led to suffering. Conversely, the countless wholesome qualities that flourish through the development of right view bring true benefit\u2026\u201d </i><span id=\"Endnote46\">[<a href=\"#endnote46\">46</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In this way, Venerable \u0100nanda emphasized that the Dhamma\u2014the noble path with its ten factors\u2014supports and fulfills the spiritual life. On the other hand, non-Dhamma leads one astray, bringing harm and hindrance to spiritual progress. Recognizing this distinction is essential for those who seek liberation.</p>\n<p>With that note we will end this section.

Here, we explore some of the most profound teachings of the Dhamma\u2014teachings that continue to illuminate the journey of countless practitioners today.</p>\n<p>Throughout the Tripitaka, the Buddha's compassionate care for his congregation\u2014the Sangha\u2014shines forth. With gentle admonishment and clear, practical instruction, he revealed every facet of the spiritual life, leaving nothing unaddressed. He showed his disciples the ropes of this noble path, guiding them step by step with unwavering care and profound wisdom. His compassionate guidance was always tailored to help them overcome the challenges of worldly suffering and move steadily toward liberation.</p>\n<p>The Buddha\u2019s unique ability to nurture and uplift his disciples remains a timeless beacon of his greatness as a spiritual leader. Even today, more than 2600 years after his great Parinibb\u0101na, the luminous Dhamma he imparted is still diligently practiced by his monastic disciples. His teachings continue to flourish in our present-day world, inspiring new generations to embrace the path of mindfulness, compassion, and awakening.</p>\n<p>May this sacred guidance inspire you to walk the path with courage and clarity. Embrace the teachings with a loving heart, and let the eternal light of the Buddha\u2019s wisdom guide you toward a life of deep inner peace and liberation!</p>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2><img src=\"page11_1/image1.jpeg\" /></h2>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2></h2>\n<p><b>Blessed One lovingly advising his disciples </b><span id=\"Endnote1\">[<a href=\"#endnote1\">1</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Freedom to Follow</h2>\n<p>The methods and techniques the Blessed One used to guide and train his disciples are truly remarkable. Among these, one of the most striking is the profound freedom inherent in the monastic path\u2014the freedom not only to enter but also to exit the community at will. Throughout his dispensation, disciples embraced the monastic vows entirely of their own accord, a testament to the empowering nature of his teachings.</p>\n<p>The Buddha\u2019s approach was always <b>\u2018ehipassika\u2019\u2014come and see\u2014</b> inviting each person to experience the truth for themselves. His teachings offered a genuine choice: to follow the path wholeheartedly or to return to lay life if it no longer resonated with one\u2019s inner calling.</p>\n<h1>To Follow the Middle Way\u2014The Noble Eightfold Path</h1>\n<p>The Buddha shared his own journey toward truth with the Sangha, revealing the profound lessons he learned on the path to liberation. Born a prince, he enjoyed the abundance of worldly pleasures and fully understood how sensuality can entangle us in the cycle of suffering. Later, as an ascetic, he subjected himself to severe austerities, mistakenly believing that extreme self-denial would lead to enlightenment. Yet, through his unwavering wisdom and effort, he discovered a far superior path\u2014the Middle Way\u2014which frees us from the bonds of suffering.</p>\n<p>The Blessed One taught his disciples to avoid both extremes: neither indulging in sensual pleasures nor pursuing self-mortification that torments the body and disrupts the mind. His own words testify to this balanced approach:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cBhikkhus, I strove indefatigably\u2026 'Willingly, let only my skin, sinews, and bones remain, and let the flesh and blood dry up in my body, but I will not relax my energy so long as I have not attained what can be attained by manly strength, energy, and exertion.' It was by heedfulness that I achieved enlightenment, bhikkhus; it was by heedfulness that I attained the unsurpassed security from bondage\u2026\u201d </i><span id=\"Endnote2\">[<a href=\"#endnote2\">2</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3>He further explained the Middle Way:</h3>\n<p>\u201cBhikkhus, these two extremes should not be followed by one who has gone forth into homelessness. <i>\u2026\u201d</i><span id=\"Endnote3\">[<a href=\"#endnote3\">3</a>]</span><i> </i></p>\n<p>What are these two extremes? On one side, the pursuit of sensual happiness in pleasures\u2014which is low, vulgar, the way of worldlings, ignoble, and unbeneficial. On the other, the pursuit of self-mortification\u2014which is painful, ignoble, and unbeneficial. Without veering toward either extreme, the Tath\u0101gata has awakened to the Middle Way\u2014a path that gives rise to vision and knowledge, leading ultimately to peace, direct insight, enlightenment, and Nibb\u0101na.</p>\n<h3>As the Buddha reminds us:</h3>\n<p>\u201cEnamoured with their pleasures and wealth,</p>\n<p>Greedy, dazed by sensual delights,</p>\n<p>They do not realize they have gone too far</p>\n<p>Like deer that enter a cleverly laid trap.\u201d<span id=\"Endnote4\">[<a href=\"#endnote4\">4</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Let the Middle Way inspire your journey! Embrace balance in your practice and in your life, knowing that every mindful step you take steers you away from the extremes that bind you to suffering. In choosing this path of moderation, wisdom, and compassion, you nurture the seeds of liberation. May you walk this noble path with courage, grace, and unwavering resolve.</p>\n<h1>The Importance of Meditation Practice\u2014Sam\u0101dhi</h1>\n<p>Here we present an inspiring insight from <b>Bhikkhu Bodhi</b> on the significance of meditation for spiritual development:</p>\n<p>\u201cThe methods of meditation taught by the Buddha in the Pali Canon fall into two broad systems. One is the development of serenity (samatha), which aims at concentration (sam\u0101dhi); the other is the development of insight (vipassan\u0101), which aims at understanding or wisdom (pa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101). In the Buddha\u2019s system of mental training, the role of serenity is subordinated to that of insight because the latter is the crucial instrument needed to uproot the ignorance at the bottom of sa\u1e43s\u0101ric bondage.</p>\n<p>The attainments possible through serenity meditation were known to Indian contemplatives long before the advent of the Buddha. The Buddha himself mastered the two highest stages under his early teachers but found that, on their own, they only led to higher planes of rebirth, not to genuine enlightenment (MN 26.15\u201316). However, because the unification of mind induced by the practice of concentration contributes to clear understanding, the Buddha incorporated the techniques of serenity meditation and the resulting levels of absorption into his own system, treating them as a foundation and preparation for insight and as a \u2018pleasant abiding here and now\u2026\u201d<span id=\"Endnote5\">[<a href=\"#endnote5\">5</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Commending Meditation</h2>\n<p>The Blessed One\u2019s teachings gently remind us that sam\u0101dhi and wisdom are inseparable allies on the journey to liberation. He encouraged his disciples to cultivate meditation, to quiet the turbulent mind and nurture a sanctuary of inner stillness. Through this practice, one learns to dissolve the clinging of lust, hate, and delusion\u2014clinging that blinds us to the radiant truth of our own nature.</p>\n<p>Deep meditation is the gateway to letting go of our desires and attachments. In that profound stillness, the seeds of true freedom and insight blossom, guiding us steadily toward the ultimate liberation of Nibb\u0101na.</p>\n<p>May this timeless wisdom inspire us all to embrace meditation as a daily practice\u2014a sacred pause where the chaos of the world recedes, and the luminous clarity of the Dhamma shines forth. Let every moment of stillness be a step closer to inner peace and lasting freedom!</p>\n<h2>Meditation: The Heart of Spiritual Awakening</h2>\n<p>In the following sutta, we witness the profound wisdom of the Blessed One as he underscores the vital role of meditation\u2014<b>Sam\u0101dhi</b>, the stillness of mind\u2014for true spiritual growth.</p>\n<p><i>\u201c\u2026Bhikkhus, the safe and good path to be travelled joyfully has been reopened by me, the wrong path has been closed off, the decoy removed, the dummy destroyed\u2026 What should be done for his disciples out of compassion by a teacher who seeks their welfare and has compassion for them, that I have done for you, bhikkhus.

Meditation is not an outdated or optional practice\u2014it is the <b>direct path</b> to true peace and awakening.</p>\n<h3>Deep Meditation: The Shield Against M\u0101ra</h3>\n<p>The Buddha urged his disciples to develop <b>Jh\u0101na</b>, the deep states of absorption, to overcome all hindrances and render M\u0101ra powerless. He gave this striking simile:</p>\n<p><b>\"Just as a forest deer wanders confidently, free from the hunter\u2019s range,</b></p>\n<p><b>so too, a bhikkhu, secluded from sensual pleasures, detached from unwholesome states,</b></p>\n<p><b>abides in the first, second, third, and fourth Jh\u0101na\u2026</b></p>\n<p><b>Such a bhikkhu has blindfolded M\u0101ra, making himself invisible to the Evil One.\u201d</b><i> </i><span id=\"Endnote9\">[<a href=\"#endnote9\">9</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This shows that meditation is not just about calmness\u2014it is a fortress against suffering, protecting the mind from distractions, defilements, and worldly traps.</p>\n<h2>The Five Fruits of Deep Sam\u0101dhi</h2>\n<p>When a dedicated practitioner cultivates <b>measureless Sam\u0101dhi</b>, developing boundless love and wisdom, five profound realizations arise:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1)\t<b>\u201cThis Sam\u0101dhi is presently pleasant and will bring future happiness.\u201d</b></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2)\t<b>\u201cThis Sam\u0101dhi is noble and spiritual.\u201d</b></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>3)\t<b>\u201cThis Sam\u0101dhi is not practiced by the worldly and the heedless.\u201d</b></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>4)\t<b>\u201cThis Sam\u0101dhi is peaceful and sublime, attained through deep tranquillity.\u201d</b></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>5)\t<b>\u201cI enter and emerge from this state mindfully, with full awareness.\u201d </b><span id=\"Endnote10\">[<a href=\"#endnote10\">10</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This measureless Sam\u0101dhi is closely linked with the <i>brahmavih\u0101ras</i>\u2014the four divine abodes of Loving-kindness, Compassion, Appreciative Joy, and Equanimity.

May our hearts find peace, may our minds find clarity, and may the path of the Blessed One lead us beyond suffering to the unshakable bliss of liberation.</p>\n<h1>Recognizing the True Teaching of the Buddha</h1>\n<p>In the following suttas, the Blessed One compassionately guided his disciples on how to discern the <b>true Dhamma</b>\u2014the genuine teaching that leads to liberation. By understanding these guiding principles, one can avoid pitfalls on the spiritual path and walk with confidence toward the ultimate goal.</p>\n<h2>The Eight Criteria for Recognizing the True Dhamma</h2>\n<p>The Buddha imparted this profound teaching to <b>Mah\u0101paj\u0101pat\u012b Gotam\u012b</b>, his stepmother, offering her a clear way to distinguish the path of truth from misleading teachings: <span id=\"Endnote12\">[<a href=\"#endnote12\">12</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Gotam\u012b, if you find that certain teachings lead:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>(1) To passion, rather than to dispassion,</p>\n<p>(2) To bondage, rather than to detachment,</p>\n<p>(3) To accumulation, rather than to renunciation,</p>\n<p>(4) To strong craving, rather than to fewness of desires,</p>\n<p>(5) To discontent, rather than to contentment,</p>\n<p>(6) To social entanglement, rather than to solitude,</p>\n<p>(7) To laziness, rather than to diligent effort,</p>\n<p>(8) To being difficult to support, rather than to being easy to support\u2014</p>\n<p>Then you should clearly recognize: <b>\u2018</b><b><i>This is not the Dhamma, this is not the discipline, </i></b></p>\n<p><b><i>this is not the teaching of the Teacher.\u2019</i></b></p>\n<p>However, if certain teachings lead:</p>\n<p>(1) To dispassion, rather than to passion,</p>\n<p>(2) To detachment, rather than to bondage,</p>\n<p>(3) To renunciation, rather than to accumulation,</p>\n<p>(4) To fewness of desires, rather than to strong craving,</p>\n<p>(5) To contentment, rather than to discontent,</p>\n<p>(6) To solitude, rather than to social entanglement,</p>\n<p>(7) To diligent effort, rather than to laziness,</p>\n<p>(8) To being easy to support, rather than to being difficult to support\u2014</p>\n<p>Then you should clearly recognize<b>: \u2018</b><b><i>This is the Dhamma, this is the discipline, </i></b></p>\n<p><b><i>this is the teaching of the Teacher.\u2019</i></b><i>\u201d</i></p>\n<h2>A Teaching to Venerable Up\u0101li: The Path to Nibb\u0101na</h2>\n<p>The Blessed One also gave a similar teaching to Venerable Up\u0101li, ensuring that his disciples would always be able to distinguish the true path:</p>\n<p>\u201cUp\u0101li, if you come across teachings that do not lead exclusively to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to peace, to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, and to Nibb\u0101na, then you should clearly recognize: \u2018This is not the Dhamma, this is not the discipline, this is not the teaching of the Teacher.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u201cHowever, if certain teachings do lead exclusively to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to peace, to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, and to Nibb\u0101na, then you should clearly recognize:</p>\n<p><b><i>\u2018This is the Dhamma, this is the discipline, this is the teaching of the Teacher</i></b><i>.\u2019</i> <span id=\"Endnote13\">[<a href=\"#endnote13\">13</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>The Timeless Relevance of the Buddha\u2019s Guidance</h3>\n<p>The Blessed One, out of boundless compassion, provided these criteria as an unfailing compass for seekers of truth. Even today, they remain a luminous guide, ensuring that the true Dhamma continues to be preserved and practiced in its purest form. May we always remember these wise instructions and walk the noble path with clarity and discernment. May the true Dhamma shine in our hearts, leading us ever closer to liberation.</p>\n<h1>The Full Understanding of Vital Factors: A Gateway to Spiritual Liberation</h1>\n<p>Throughout his life, the Blessed One repeatedly urged his disciples to gain deep insight into sensual pleasures, material form, and feelings. When these aspects of experience are fully understood as they truly are, their inherent impermanence and unreliability become evident. This realization unveils the path to liberation, leading one beyond suffering. The following sutta illuminates this profound truth.</p>\n<h3>The Buddha\u2019s Distinction: Understanding Leads to Liberation</h3>\n<p>Once, a group of bhikkhus on their alms round encountered wanderers from other sects who challenged them: <span id=\"Endnote14\">[<a href=\"#endnote14\">14</a>]</span></p>\n<p><i>\u201cFriends, the recluse Gotama speaks of the full understanding of sensual pleasures, material form, and feelings\u2014we, too, speak of the same. What, then, is the distinction between his teachings and ours? What sets his instructions apart</i>?\u201d</p>\n<p>Puzzled, the bhikkhus approached the Blessed One and relayed the encounter. The Buddha, in his infinite wisdom, clarified:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cBhikkhus, if wanderers of other sects claim to teach full understanding, they should be asked: \u2018What is the gratification, what is the danger, and what is the escape in the case of sensual pleasures, material form, and feelings?\u2019</p>\n<p></i></p>\n<p>When questioned in this way, they will not be able to answer. Why? Because such understanding does not belong to them\u2014it is not their domain.</p>\n<p>Those recluses who fail to see the gratification as gratification, the danger as danger, and the escape as escape cannot fully comprehend these aspects for themselves, nor can they guide another toward full understanding\u2014this is impossible.</p>\n<p><b>\u201cBut those who truly see reality as it is\u2014the allure, the peril, and the way out\u2014are capable not only of liberating themselves but also of leading others toward the same realization. This is the great distinction of the Tath\u0101gata\u2019s teaching.\u201d</b></p>\n<h2>Breaking Free from Sensual Attachments: The Path of True Renunciation</h2>\n<p>In the Ariyapariyesan\u0101 Sutta (MN:26), the Buddha further emphasized the need to transcend sensual entanglements and cultivate inner freedom:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cRecluses who are not bound by the five cords of sensual pleasure, who are not intoxicated or ensnared by them, but instead use them wisely\u2014seeing the danger they hold and understanding the path of escape\u2014are truly free.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>Of such noble ones, it may be rightly said: \u2018<b>They have avoided calamity and disaster. The Evil One has no hold over them and cannot lead them astray.\u2019</b></p>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2>The Timeless Relevance of the Buddha\u2019s Teachings</h2>\n<p>The Blessed One\u2019s guidance offers an unshakable foundation for those seeking true liberation. By clearly recognizing the fleeting satisfaction of worldly pleasures, the suffering they conceal, and the path to freedom, one gains the wisdom to walk unburdened toward Nibb\u0101na.</p>\n<p>May we all cultivate the insight to see things as they truly are, to discern the path of escape from suffering, and to walk this noble journey with wisdom and courage. May the Dhamma illuminate our path to ultimate peace!</p>\n<h1>The Fourfold Method: How the Buddha Trained His Disciples</h1>\n<p>In his boundless compassion and wisdom, the Blessed One guided his disciples using four distinct methods, adapting his approach to suit each individual\u2019s disposition and capacity for growth. The following sutta reveals the depth of his skilful means in training those who sought the path to liberation.</p>\n<p><i>\u201cI discipline some gently, others sternly, and still others through a combination of both. But if a person refuses to be tamed by any of these methods, I \u2018kill\u2019 them.\u201d </i><span id=\"Endnote15\">[<a href=\"#endnote15\">15</a>]</span><i> </i></p>\n<p>Hearing this, Kesi, a renowned horse trainer, was taken aback. He asked:</p>\n<p>\u201cBut Bhante, it is not allowable for the Blessed One to destroy life. Yet you say, \u2018Then I kill him.\u2019 What do you mean by this?\u201d</p>\n<p>The Buddha then explained:</p>\n<p>\u201cIndeed, Kesi, the Tath\u0101gata does not take life. However, if someone refuses to be tamed\u2014rejecting both gentle and stern instruction\u2014then I no longer engage with them. I do not speak to them, nor do wise monks attempt to guide them further. In the Noble One\u2019s discipline, this is what is meant by \u2018killing\u2019\u2014it is the withdrawal of instruction when all skilful means have failed.\u201d<span id=\"Endnote16\">[<a href=\"#endnote16\">16</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>The Buddha\u2019s Four Methods of Training</h2>\n<p>1\ufe0f <b>The Gentle Approach</b> \u2013 The Buddha patiently guided his disciples by emphasizing the benefits of wholesome conduct:</p>\n<p>\u201cSuch is the merit of bodily good conduct and its results\u2026 such is verbal good conduct\u2026 such is mental good conduct\u2026 such is the realm of the devas and the rewards of human birth.\u201d</p>\n<p>2\ufe0f<b>The Stern Approach</b> \u2013 At times, he used strong admonition to highlight the consequences of unwholesome actions:</p>\n<p>\u201cSuch is the suffering caused by bodily misconduct\u2026 such is the result of verbal misconduct\u2026 such is the downfall of mental misconduct. Such are the torments of hell, the suffering of the animal realm, and the misfortune of the afflicted spirits.\u201d</p>\n<p>3\ufe0f <b>The Combined Approach</b> \u2013 For some, he used both encouragement and warning, balancing inspiration with caution:</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is the reward of good conduct, and this is the danger of misconduct. This is the path to the divine realms, and this is the descent into suffering.\u201d</p>\n<p>4\ufe0f <b>The Final Measure</b> \u2013 When a disciple persistently refused to be guided, the Buddha would withdraw his teachings, allowing them to face the natural consequences of their choices. This, he described as a form of \u2018<b>killing\u2019 in the Noble One\u2019s discipline</b>\u2014not a physical act, but a complete disengagement, as further instruction would bear no fruit.</p>\n<h3>A Masterful Teacher of the Path</h3>\n<p>The Buddha\u2019s method was not rigid; it was a skilful art of guidance, designed to awaken wisdom in each individual. His compassionate training ensured that those who were willing to listen and learn could progress toward liberation.</p>\n<p>May we too be receptive to gentle encouragement, firm admonition, and the guidance that leads to the highest freedom. May we never close our hearts to the truth but always walk the path with humility, wisdom, and diligence.</p>\n<h1>The Noble Qualities That Make the Sangha Worthy</h1>\n<p>Throughout his teachings, the Blessed One repeatedly encouraged his disciples to cultivate noble qualities that would make them worthy of honour and reverence. In the following suttas, we see how the Buddha admonished his monastics, emphasizing the virtues that elevate them as an unsurpassed field of merit for the world.</p>\n<h2>The Four Essential Qualities of a Worthy Monk</h2>\n<p>The Buddha declared:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cBhikkhus, when a monk possesses four qualities, he is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, and worthy of reverential salutation.

The following suttas illustrate the importance of wise discernment in our deeds.</p>\n<h2>The Four Deeds to Be Carefully Reflected Upon</h2>\n<p>The Buddha taught:<i> </i></p>\n<p>There are four kinds of deeds that one should carefully consider:<i> </i><span id=\"Endnote20\">[<a href=\"#endnote20\">20</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1\ufe0f <b>Disagreeable to do and harmful</b> \u2013 One reflects: <i>\"This action is both unpleasant to undertake and leads to harmful results.\"</i> Recognizing this, one should refrain from performing such a deed.</p>\n<p>2\ufe0f <b>Disagreeable to do but beneficial</b> \u2013 This reveals the distinction between a fool and a wise person regarding strength, effort, and determination.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\tThe fool does not reflect: <i>\"Though this deed is difficult and unpleasant, it will bring good results.\"</i> Thus, he avoids it, and his avoidance leads to harm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\tThe wise person reflects: <i>\"Though this deed is difficult and unpleasant, it will bring beneficial results.\"</i> So, he courageously undertakes it, and his effort leads to well-being.</p>\n<p>3\ufe0f <b>Agreeable to do but harmful</b> \u2013 This too differentiates the wise from the foolish.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\tThe fool does not reflect: <i>\"Though this deed is pleasant and easy, it will bring harmful results.\"</i> Thus, he carelessly pursues it, bringing harm to himself and others.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\tThe wise person reflects: <i>\"Though this deed is pleasant and easy, it will lead to suffering.\"</i> Recognizing this, he refrains from engaging in it, and his restraint leads to benefit.</p>\n<p>4\ufe0f <b>Agreeable to do and beneficial</b> \u2013 Such an action should be <b>wholeheartedly pursued</b>, for it is both pleasant to undertake and brings good results.</p>\n<p>Thus, wise reflection ensures that only skilful actions are performed while unskilful ones are avoided.</p>\n<h3>Guarding the Three Doors: Preventing Unskilful Actions</h3>\n<p>In the <i>Ambala\u1e6d\u1e6dhik\u0101r\u0101hulov\u0101da Sutta</i> (MN: 61), the Buddha advised Venerable R\u0101hula on the importance of careful reflection in bodily, verbal, and mental actions:</p>\n<p>Before engaging in any action\u2014whether through body, speech, or mind\u2014one should reflect deeply:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\t<i>Will this action lead to my own suffering, the suffering of others, or the suffering of both?</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\t<i>Is this an unwholesome action that will bring painful consequences?</i></p>\n<p>If, upon reflection, one realizes: <i>\u2018Yes, this action will lead to harm and suffering,\u2019</i> then such an action should be completely avoided.</p>\n<p>However, if one sees: <i>\u2018No, this action will not cause harm; rather, it is wholesome and leads to happiness and good results,\u2019</i> then such an action may be undertaken.\u201d</p>\n<p>By practicing <b>wise reflection</b>, one <b>guards the three doors</b>\u2014body, speech, and mind\u2014ensuring that all actions lead to one\u2019s own well-being and the well-being of others.</p>\n<h3>Walking the Path of Wisdom</h3>\n<p>The path to liberation is not simply about avoiding wrongdoing but also about cultivating skilful, wholesome actions that lead to true peace. The wise reflect carefully before every deed, ensuring that their actions align with the Dhamma.</p>\n<p>May we all be mindful in our thoughts, speech, and actions, walking the Noble Path with wisdom and compassion!</p>\n<h1>Practicing Heedfulness in All Deeds</h1>\n<p>The Blessed One taught:</p>\n<p><b>\"Bhikkhus, there are four occasions when heedfulness should be diligently practiced:</b></p>\n<p>1\ufe0f <i>Abandon bodily misconduct and cultivate wholesome bodily conduct\u2014be heedful in this.</i></p>\n<p>2\ufe0f <i>Abandon verbal misconduct and cultivate wholesome speech\u2014be heedful in this.</i></p>\n<p>3\ufe0f <i>Abandon mental misconduct and cultivate wholesome thoughts\u2014be heedful in this.</i></p>\n<p>4\ufe0f <i>Abandon wrong view and cultivate right view\u2014be heedful in this.</i></p>\n<p><b>\u201cWhen a bhikkhu has abandoned misconduct and cultivated virtue, has discarded wrong views and developed right view, he has nothing to fear\u2014not even death itself.\u201d</b></p>\n<p>By practicing <b>heedfulness (appam\u0101da)</b> in body, speech, and mind, one safeguards the path to liberation, ensuring steady progress toward Nibb\u0101na. <span id=\"Endnote21\">[<a href=\"#endnote21\">21</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>The Beauty of Restraint</h3>\n<p><i>Restraint in the eye is good; restraint in the ear is good;</i></p>\n<p><i>Restraint in the nose is good; restraint in the tongue is good.</i></p>\n<p><i>Restraint in deeds is good; restraint in speech is good;</i></p>\n<p><i>Restraint in the mind is good; indeed, restraint in everything is good.</i></p>\n<p><i>A monk who is restrained in all ways is freed from all sorrow.</i><span id=\"Endnote22\">[<a href=\"#endnote22\">22</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>By guarding the senses and living with discipline, one attains peace and freedom from suffering.</p>\n<h1>Guarding the Spiritual Life</h1>\n<p>As a compassionate teacher, the Blessed One often guided the Sangha in <b>avoiding obstacles</b> that could hinder spiritual progress.

Among the many reflections he recommended, one of the most profound is the practice of being an island unto oneself.</p>\n<h3>To Be an Island unto Oneself</h3>\n<p>The Buddha gave this timeless advice: <span id=\"Endnote34\">[<a href=\"#endnote34\">34</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\"\u0100nanda, you should live as islands unto yourselves, being your own refuge, with no one else as your refuge, with the Dhamma as an island, with the Dhamma as your refuge, with no other refuge\u201d.</i></p>\n<p><b>And how does a monk live as an island unto himself, with no other refuge? </b></p>\n<p>Here, \u0100nanda, a monk abides contemplating the body as body\u2014earnestly, with clear awareness and mindfulness\u2014having put away all hankering and fretting for the world. Likewise, he abides contemplating feelings as feelings, mind as mind, and mind-objects as mind-objects... And those who, in my time or after my passing, live thus\u2014if they are desirous of learning\u2014they will reach the highest. <span id=\"Endnote35\">[<a href=\"#endnote35\">35</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>With these words, the Blessed One emphasized the importance of self-reliance in practice, urging his disciples to take refuge in the Dhamma and diligently cultivate mindfulness and wisdom. Those who steadfastly follow this path will realize the highest truth, unshaken by the changing tides of the world.</p>\n<h1>Respect for Teachers, Elders, and Fellow Members of the Sa\u1e45gha</h1>\n<p>For the spiritual growth and harmony of the Sa\u1e45gha, the Blessed One frequently emphasized the importance of respect and reverence towards those worthies of honour.<i> </i><span id=\"Endnote36\">[<a href=\"#endnote36\">36</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>At the heart of this teaching is the deep respect and obedience owed to the Teacher. The Buddha stressed that <b>honouring one\u2019s teacher</b> is essential, for such reverence nurtures humility, wisdom, and the capacity to receive profound guidance. Similarly, respecting elders in the Dhamma is of great importance, as they provide invaluable counsel and illuminate the right path for spiritual progress.</p>\n<p>Beyond this, the Blessed One also urged the Sa\u1e45gha to <b>cultivate mutual respect among fellow monks and nuns</b>. Such conduct fosters harmony within the monastic community and serves as an inspiring example for the lay followers.

He encouraged householders to cultivate happiness in family life while nurturing their spiritual development.</p>\n<p>The Buddha urged his lay disciples\u2014known as up\u0101saka (male lay followers) and up\u0101sik\u0101 (female lay followers)\u2014to uphold the five precepts as the foundation of a virtuous life. He also encouraged them to observe the eight precepts on full moon days and to lead lives of peace, kindness, and compassion toward all living beings.</p>\n<p>The following are selected extracts from the scriptures that illustrate his profound guidance for lay practitioners.</p>\n<h1>How to Live a Household Life with Contentment</h1>\n<p></p>\n<p>Advice to Young Sig\u0101laka<b> </b><span id=\"Endnote2\">[<a href=\"#endnote2\">2</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>On one occasion, the Blessed One encountered a young householder, Sig\u0101laka, who was paying homage to the six directions. Seeing this, the Buddha asked him about the purpose of his practice. Sig\u0101laka replied:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cLord, my father, when he was dying, instructed me to do so. And so, out of respect for my father\u2019s words, which I revere, honour, and hold sacred, I rise early each day to pay homage in this way to the six directions.\u201d</i><span id=\"Endnote3\">[<a href=\"#endnote3\">3</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Hearing this, the Buddha gently explained that an Ariyan disciple pays homage to the six directions in a different way\u2014one that leads to true well-being and protection in both this life and the next. Eager to learn, Sig\u0101laka asked about this noble practice, and the Blessed One responded:</p>\n<p><i>\u201c\u2026Young householder, it is by abandoning the four defilements of action, by refraining from the four causes of wrongdoing, and by not following the six ways of squandering one\u2019s wealth\u2014through avoiding these fourteen evil ways\u2014that the Ariyan disciple truly covers the six directions. By practicing in this way, he becomes a conqueror of both worlds, ensuring well-being in this life and the next.

These seven qualities are:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1)\tAbstaining from killing</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2)\tAbstaining from stealing</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>3)\tAbstaining from sexual misconduct</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>4)\tAbstaining from false speech</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>5)\tAbstaining from harsh speech</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>6)\tAbstaining from divisive speech</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>7)\tAbstaining from idle chatter</p>\n<h3>The Four Desirable States</h3>\n<p>By cultivating these four qualities, a lay disciple establishes a strong foundation for both worldly and spiritual well-being:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1)\t<b>Confidence in the Buddha</b> \u2013 Trusting in the wisdom and awakening of the Blessed One</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2)\t<b>Confidence in the Dhamma</b> \u2013 Trusting in the path that leads to liberation</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>3)\t<b>Confidence in the Sangha</b> \u2013 Trusting in the community of noble disciples</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>4)\t<b>Possessing unbroken virtue</b> \u2013 Upholding moral discipline with sincerity and care</p>\n<p>Through the cultivation of these qualities, a lay follower ensures happiness in this life and secures a fortunate rebirth in the next.</p>\n<h2>The Advice to Young D\u012bghaj\u0101\u1e47u </h2>\n<p>On another occasion, a young man of the Koliyan clan, named D\u012bghaj\u0101\u1e47u, approached the Blessed One, paid homage, and requested guidance: <span id=\"Endnote7\">[<a href=\"#endnote7\">7</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\u201cBhante, we are laypeople enjoying sensual pleasures, living at home in households filled with children.

What four?</p>\n<h3>The Four Factors for Well-being in This Life</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>1)\t<b>Accomplishment in Initiative</b> \u2013 A layperson should be skilful, diligent, and wise in managing their livelihood, ensuring that their efforts lead to success and well-being.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2)\t<b>Accomplishment in Protection</b> \u2013 One should take necessary measures to safeguard wealth from kings, thieves, misfortune, and unworthy heirs.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>3)\t<b>Cultivating Good Friendship</b> \u2013 Associating with wise and virtuous people leads to spiritual growth and wholesome living.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>4)\t<b>Balanced Living</b> \u2013 One should manage income wisely, neither living in excess nor being overly frugal, while avoiding reckless behaviours such as womanizing, drunkenness, gambling, and associating with bad companions<b>.</b></p>\n<h3>The Four Factors for Well-being in Future Lives</h3>\n<p>Beyond material well-being, the Buddha emphasized four qualities that ensure happiness in future lives:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1)\t<b>Accomplishment in Faith</b> \u2013 Having unwavering confidence in the Triple Gem</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2)\t<b>Accomplishment in Virtuous Conduct</b> \u2013 Leading a life of moral discipline</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>3)\t<b>Accomplishment in Generosity</b> \u2013 Practicing selflessness and charity</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>4)\t<b>Accomplishment in Wisdom</b> \u2013 Cultivating insight that leads to liberation</p>\n<p>By following these teachings, a layperson secures both worldly prosperity and spiritual advancement, leading to true and lasting happiness.</p>\n<h1>The Importance of Caring for One\u2019s Parents</h1>\n<p>The Buddha often emphasized the profound duty of caring for one\u2019s parents, recognizing it as both a moral responsibility and a source of great merit. In his teachings, he highlighted two essential aspects of this duty:</p>\n<p>Providing material support and comfort to one\u2019s parents.<span id=\"Endnote8\">[<a href=\"#endnote8\">8</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1)\tGuiding them on the path of Dhamma\u2014encouraging them to take refuge in the Triple Gem, cultivate Right View, and progress toward spiritual awakening, even to the level of stream-entry.</p>\n<p>The Blessed One did not merely instruct others on honouring their parents\u2014he personally exemplified this virtue. He not only cared for his own parents but also helped his stepmother, who raised him with great love and devotion, to advance on the spiritual path and attain liberation from the endless cycle of suffering. This has been discussed in greater detail in Section 2 of this compilation.</p>\n<p>The following passage from the scriptures beautifully illustrates the Buddha\u2019s guidance on filial duty and the immeasurable gratitude one owes to their parents:</p>\n<h3>Parents\u2014The First Teachers of Their Children</h3>\n<p>\"Mother and father are called \u2018Brahm\u0101\u2019 (sublime ones),</p>\n<p>and also \u2018first teachers.\u2019</p>\n<p>They are worthy of gifts from their children,</p>\n<p>for they have boundless compassion for their offspring.</p>\n<p>Therefore, a wise person should revere them,</p>\n<p>honour them with love and respect,</p>\n<p>serve them with food and drink,</p>\n<p>with clothes and bedding,</p>\n<p>by massaging and bathing them,</p>\n<p>and by washing their feet.</p>\n<p>By rendering such devoted service</p>\n<p>to one\u2019s mother and father,</p>\n<p>the wise are praised in this very life,</p>\n<p>and after death, they rejoice in heaven.\u201d<span id=\"Endnote9\">[<a href=\"#endnote9\">9</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Two Persons Who Cannot Easily Be Repaid</h2>\n<p>The Buddha taught that repaying one\u2019s parents is one of the most difficult debts to fulfill. No matter how much wealth or power one bestows upon them, it still falls short of true repayment. However, if one can guide their parents toward the path of Dhamma and establish them in faith, virtue, generosity, and wisdom, then they have truly honoured their parents in the highest way.</p>\n<p>The Blessed One said:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cEven if one were to make one\u2019s parents the supreme rulers over this vast earth, abundant with the seven treasures, one still would not have fully repaid them. Why? Because parents are of immense benefit to their children\u2014they nurture them, provide for them, and introduce them to the world. However, if one helps parents develop faith when they lack faith, virtue when they lack virtue, generosity when they lack generosity, and wisdom when they lack wisdom\u2014then one has truly repaid them, and even done more than enough for them.\u201d</i><span id=\"Endnote10\">[<a href=\"#endnote10\">10</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The scriptures further praise those who care for their parents with diligence and devotion:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cThe wise person, dwelling at home,</p>\n<p>truly lives for the good of many.</p>\n<p>Day and night, devoted to his mother, father, and ancestors,</p>\n<p>he honours them in accordance with the Dhamma,</p>\n<p>recollecting the boundless kindness they have shown him.\u201d</i> <span id=\"Endnote11\">[<a href=\"#endnote11\">11</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>The Importance of Making Merit and Sharing It</h1>\n<p>Another essential teaching the Buddha gave to lay followers was the practice of accumulating merit and dedicating it to departed relatives. He emphasized that beings in certain realms eagerly await such offerings, as these acts of generosity bring them great benefit.</p>\n<h2>Merit\u2014A Source of True Happiness</h2>\n<p>The Blessed One encouraged all, including his monastic disciples, not to fear making merit, for it is the foundation of happiness and spiritual progress. Reflecting on his own past lives, he described the immense benefits he had gained through the practice of merit: <span id=\"Endnote12\">[<a href=\"#endnote12\">12</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\u201cDo not be afraid of merit\u2014merit is another name for happiness. I recall that for a long time, I experienced the desirable, lovely, and agreeable results of merit accumulated over many lifetimes. For seven years, I cultivated a mind of loving-kindness. As a result, for seven world cycles of dissolution and reformation, I never returned to this world of suffering. Instead, I was reborn in the realm of streaming radiance. When the world was re-formed, I became a great Brahm\u0101\u2026 I was Sakka, lord of the gods\u2026 and hundreds of times I was a wheel-turning monarch.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>Thus, the Buddha advised:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cOne who aspires for the highest good,</p>\n<p>who seeks true greatness,</p>\n<p>should deeply revere the noble Dhamma,</p>\n<p>ever mindful of the Buddhas\u2019 timeless teachings.\u201d</i></p>\n<h2>The Great Benefits of Making Merit</h2>\n<p>The Buddha emphasized that making merit is the foundation of true happiness and spiritual progress. Through generosity, virtuous conduct, and meditative cultivation, one creates the conditions for a fortunate life and favourable rebirths.</p>\n<h3>Merit Leads to Prosperity and Well-Being</h3>\n<p>In one discourse, the Blessed One highlighted the importance of living in a suitable place and associating with noble friends, as these factors support a person in accumulating merit, which in turn leads to prosperity and good fortune:</p>\n<p><i>\u201c\u2026When a person dwells in a suitable locality</p>\n<p>and makes friends with the noble ones,</p>\n<p>when he has formed right resolutions</p>\n<p>and done deeds of merit in the past,</p>\n<p>grain, riches, fame, and reputation,</p>\n<p>along with happiness accrue to him.\u201d </i><span id=\"Endnote13\">[<a href=\"#endnote13\">13</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Merit Supports Good Rebirths</h3>\n<p>The Buddha also taught that acts of generosity\u2014such as offering gifts, providing food, and supporting the virtuous, travellers, and the sick\u2014bring joy not only in this life but also in future existences: <span id=\"Endnote14\">[<a href=\"#endnote14\">14</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\u201cTherefore, with an unwavering mind,</p>\n<p>one should give gifts where they yield great fruit.</p>\n<p>Merit is the true support of beings</p>\n<p>when they arise in the other world.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>The Buddha praised Suppav\u0101s\u0101, <span id=\"Endnote15\">[<a href=\"#endnote15\">15</a>]</span> the daughter of the Koliyan clan, for her generosity in offering food to him and the Sangha, declaring that her wholesome deeds would bring immense blessings: <span id=\"Endnote16\">[<a href=\"#endnote16\">16</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\u201c\u2026Those who recollect such generosity</p>\n<p>dwell in the world inspired by joy.</p>\n<p>Having uprooted the stain of miserliness,</p>\n<p>pure and blameless, they ascend to the heavenly realms.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>Additionally, the Blessed One explained that three fundamental bases of merit lead to favourable rebirths: <span id=\"Endnote17\">[<a href=\"#endnote17\">17</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1)\t<b>Generosity (D\u0101na):</b> Acts of giving, which cultivate selflessness and compassion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2)\t<b>Virtuous Conduct (S\u012bla):</b> Moral discipline that purifies the mind and heart.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>3)\t<b>Meditative Development (Bh\u0101van\u0101):</b> The cultivation of wisdom through mindfulness and meditation.</p>\n<p><i>\u201cEven if one practices these three bases of merit in an average way,</p>\n<p>they will be reborn among humans in favourable conditions.</p>\n<p>But if one practices them in an excellent manner,</p>\n<p>they will attain rebirth in the celestial realms.\u201d</i></p>\n<h2>Sharing Merit (Pu\u00f1\u00f1a) with Departed Relatives</h2>\n<p>A significant aspect of Buddhist tradition is the dedication of merit to departed loved ones. The Buddha frequently advised his followers to transfer the merits of their good deeds to their ancestors, as beings in the spirit realms often await such offerings.</p>\n<p>A well-known example is King Bimbis\u0101ra\u2019s act of merit when he donated the first monastery to the Buddha and the Sangha. <span id=\"Endnote18\">[<a href=\"#endnote18\">18</a>]</span> According to tradition, his departed relatives, suffering in the lower realms, longed for the merit of his generosity. Failing to receive it, they appeared in his dreams, prompting the king to seek the Buddha\u2019s guidance. The Blessed One, using his supernormal insight, confirmed that these beings were indeed awaiting merit. Upon the Buddha\u2019s advice, the king made additional offerings and dedicated the merit to them, leading to their release from suffering.</p>\n<p>The Buddha then gave this profound discourse on the importance of remembering and supporting one\u2019s departed relatives:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cThey stand beyond the walls,</p>\n<p>at the junctions and crossroads,</p>\n<p>they linger at the doorposts,</p>\n<p>returning to their former homes.</i></p>\n<p><i>Yet when food and drink,</p>\n<p>abundant and well-prepared,</p>\n<p>is offered in generosity,</p>\n<p>they remain forgotten.</i></p>\n<p><i>But the compassionate, those with wisdom,</p>\n<p>give to their departed relatives.</p>\n<p>They offer pure and suitable gifts,</p>\n<p>at the right time, with heartfelt devotion.</i></p>\n<p><i>Thinking: \u2018May this reach our loved ones,</p>\n<p>may they find peace and happiness!\u2019</p>\n<p></i></p>\n<p><i>The assembled spirits rejoice,</p>\n<p>accepting the offerings with gratitude.</i></p>\n<p><i>And in turn, they bless their benefactors,</p>\n<p>saying: \u2018May you live long!</p>\n<p>May you prosper in goodness!</p>\n<p>For you have honoured us,</p>\n<p>and those who give are never without reward.\u2019 </i><span id=\"Endnote19\">[<a href=\"#endnote19\">19</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Thus, the Buddha taught that by making merit and dedicating it to others\u2014whether the living or the departed\u2014one fosters happiness, deepens spiritual progress, and strengthens the bonds of compassion that extend beyond this life.</p>\n<h3>The Importance of Offering Merit to Departed Relatives</h3>\n<p>Following is another discourse beautifully illustrates the significance of dedicating merit to our departed loved ones.</p>\n<p>On one occasion, the Brahmin J\u0101\u1e47usso\u1e47\u012b <span id=\"Endnote20\">[<a href=\"#endnote20\">20</a>]</span>  approached the Blessed One and asked:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cMaster Gotama, we Brahmins offer gifts and perform memorial rites for the dead with the thought: \u2018May our offerings benefit our departed relatives\u2026 May they partake of these merits.\u2019 But, Master Gotama, can our gifts truly be of benefit to them?\u201d </i><span id=\"Endnote21\">[<a href=\"#endnote21\">21</a>]</span><i> </i></p>\n<p>In response, the Buddha gave a profound teaching on the existence of certain departed beings who reside in a realm where they can receive and benefit from such offerings. He further explained that throughout this vast cycle of sa\u1e43s\u0101ra, it is impossible to say that our loved ones have never been reborn in unfortunate states, awaiting the merit of their relatives.</p>\n<p>The Buddha concluded by affirming that there are indeed beings who can benefit from alms given in their memory, and that those who make such offerings also accumulate great merit for themselves.</p>\n<p>Deeply moved by this teaching, Brahmin J\u0101\u1e47usso\u1e47\u012b exclaimed:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cIt is truly astounding, Master Gotama, and most wonderful! There is indeed great reason to give gifts and perform memorial rites for the departed, for such acts bring benefit not only to the recipients but also to the givers themselves.\u201d </i><span id=\"Endnote22\">[<a href=\"#endnote22\">22</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>How to Take Food for Good Health</h1>\n<p>The Buddha also provided practical advice on how to consume food mindfully to maintain good digestion and overall health. He frequently emphasized that a healthy body serves as a strong foundation for developing meditation and inner stillness.</p>\n<p><i>\u201cOne who is always mindful,</p>\n<p>knowing moderation in the food they eat,</p>\n<p>experiences a reduction in ailments.</p>\n<p>They age slowly, preserving their life.\u201d </i><span id=\"Endnote23\">[<a href=\"#endnote23\">23</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>By eating in moderation and with awareness, one fosters both physical well-being and spiritual clarity.</p>\n<h1>How a Buddhist Should Dwell in Home Life</h1>\n<p>The Buddha frequently encouraged lay followers to cultivate generosity by supporting monks, nuns, and ascetics who dedicate themselves to spiritual practice, as well as by providing for family members, the poor, and those in need of food and clothing.</p>\n<p>In addition to acts of generosity, he urged laypeople to develop meditative recollections (<i>anusati bh\u0101van\u0101</i>) to strengthen their spiritual progress. These include:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1)\t<b>Recollection of the Buddha\u2019s qualities</b></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2)\t<b>Recollection of the Dhamma\u2019s purity</b></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>3)\t<b>Recollection of the Sangha\u2019s virtue</b></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>4)\t<b>Recollection of one\u2019s own moral integrity</b></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>5)\t<b>Recollection of one\u2019s generosity and past good deeds</b></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>6)\t<b>Recollection of the higher qualities of celestial beings (devas), inspiring one to cultivate wholesome qualities</b></p>\n<p>A well-known example of this guidance is found in the discourse given to Mahan\u0101ma the Sakyan. When he approached the Blessed One and asked how a layperson should live while engaging in worldly responsibilities, the Buddha instructed him to cultivate: <span id=\"Endnote24\">[<a href=\"#endnote24\">24</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\t<b>Faith</b> (saddh\u0101) in the Triple Gem</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\t<b>Energy</b> (viriya) to uphold wholesome practices</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\t<b>Mindfulness</b> (sati) to stay attentive and aware</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\t<b>Stillness of mind</b> (sam\u0101dhi) to develop inner peace</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\t<b>Wisdom</b> (pa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101) to discern the true nature of life</p>\n<p>By integrating these principles into daily life, lay practitioners create a strong foundation for spiritual growth while fulfilling their worldly duties with wisdom and compassion.</p>\n<h1><img src=\"page11_2/image2.png\" /></h1>\n<h1></h1>\n<h1></h1>\n<h1></h1>\n<h1></h1>\n<h1></h1>\n<h1></h1>\n<h1></h1>\n<h1></h1>\n<h1></h1>\n<h1></h1>\n<p><b>The Blessed One dedicated his life to teaching the Dhamma, imparting wisdom and guidance to both monastics and lay devotees for their lasting happiness in this world and beyond</b><span id=\"Endnote25\">[<a href=\"#endnote25\">25</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>Keeping Precepts Brings Happiness in This Life and Favourable Rebirth</h1>\n<p>The Buddha emphasized the importance of moral discipline for lay followers, encouraging them to observe the Five Precepts in daily life and the Eight Precepts on Uposatha <span id=\"Endnote26\">[<a href=\"#endnote26\">26</a>]</span>. (observance) days. These ethical guidelines not only cultivate inner peace but also lead to happiness in this life and favourable rebirths in the next.</p>\n<p>The following suttas highlight the profound benefits of keeping precepts:</p>\n<h3>The Five Precepts: A Path to Fearlessness and Well-being</h3>\n<p>The Buddha declared:</p>\n<p>There are five gifts\u2014great gifts, ancient and unadulterated, upheld by wise ascetics and brahmins. What five? <span id=\"Endnote27\">[<a href=\"#endnote27\">27</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1)\tAbstaining from the destruction of life</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2)\tAbstaining from taking what is not given</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>3)\tAbstaining from sexual misconduct</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>4)\tAbstaining from false speech</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>5)\tAbstaining from intoxicating drinks and drugs</p>\n<p>By observing these precepts, one grants an immeasurable number of beings freedom from fear, enmity, and affliction. In return, one also enjoys freedom from fear, enmity, and affliction. Keeping these precepts brings happiness in this life and ensures a favourable rebirth.</p>\n<h3>The Eight Precepts: A Path to Higher Virtue and Heavenly Bliss</h3>\n<p>The Eight Precepts are traditionally observed on Full Moon and Uposatha days, fostering deeper spiritual practice. They are:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1)\tAbstaining from killing</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2)\tAbstaining from stealing</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>3)\tAbstaining from sexual activity</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>4)\tAbstaining from false speech</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>5)\tAbstaining from intoxicants</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>6)\tAbstaining from eating after noon</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>7)\tAbstaining from entertainment and personal adornment</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>8)\tAbstaining from using luxurious beds and seats</p>\n<p>The Buddha extolled the immense merit of observing the Eight Precepts, as illustrated in the following verse: <span id=\"Endnote28\">[<a href=\"#endnote28\">28</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\u201cWhatever treasures exist in this world\u2014</i></p>\n<p><i>pearls, gems, and precious gold,</i></p>\n<p><i>are not worth a sixteenth part</i></p>\n<p><i>of an Uposatha observed in full.</i></p>\n<p><i>Thus, a virtuous woman or man,</i></p>\n<p><i>who upholds these eight factors</i></p>\n<p><i>and generates merit leading to happiness,</i></p>\n<p><i>will, blameless, attain a heavenly state.\u201d</i></p>\n<h1>The Blessings of Generosity</h1>\n<p>The Buddha repeatedly praised generosity, encouraging laypeople to offer alms to monks and ascetics, support the needy, and care for the sick.</p>\n<p>In one discourse, the Buddha described the qualities of a noble giver: <span id=\"Endnote29\">[<a href=\"#endnote29\">29</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1)\tThey give what is pure</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2)\tThey give what is excellent</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>3)\tThey give at the right time</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>4)\tThey give what is appropriate</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>5)\tThey give with wisdom and discernment</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>6)\tThey give frequently</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>7)\tWhile giving, their heart is filled with confidence</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>8)\tAfter giving, they rejoice in their generosity</p>\n<p>\u201cA noble giver shares what is pure and excellent,</p>\n<p>timely and appropriate food and drink.</p>\n<p>They offer gifts frequently,</p>\n<p>supporting those who walk the spiritual path.</p>\n<p>Having given with a heart full of faith,</p>\n<p>they feel no regret but rejoice in their deeds.\u201d <span id=\"Endnote30\">[<a href=\"#endnote30\">30</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cThe wise praise such generosity,</p>\n<p>for it leads to future happiness.</p>\n<p>One who is intelligent, full of faith,</p>\n<p>and rich in virtue is reborn in a peaceful, blissful realm.\u201d  <span id=\"Endnote31\">[<a href=\"#endnote31\">31</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>The Path to the Divine Realms</h1>\n<p><i>\u201cFaith, moral shame, and wholesome giving</i></p>\n<p><i>are qualities cherished by the noble ones.</i></p>\n<p><i>For this, they say, is the divine path,</i></p>\n<p><i>leading to the radiant world of the devas.\u201d</i> <span id=\"Endnote32\">[<a href=\"#endnote32\">32</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>By observing precepts and cultivating generosity, one paves the way for both present happiness and future liberation.</p>\n<h1>How to Be Free from Suffering</h1>\n<p>On one occasion, the headman Bhadraka approached the Buddha and said:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cVenerable sir, it would be good if the Blessed One could teach me about the origin and cessation of suffering.\u201d</i> <span id=\"Endnote33\">[<a href=\"#endnote33\">33</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In response, the Buddha engaged in a dialogue, leading Bhadraka to discover for himself how suffering arises and how it ceases:</p>\n<p><b>Buddha:</b> <i>\u201cWhat do you think, headman? Are there people in Uruvelakappa on whose account sorrow and pain would arise in you if they were to be executed, imprisoned, or censured?\u201d</i></p>\n<p><b>Bhadraka:</b> <i>\u201cYes, venerable sir, there are such people.\u201d</i></p>\n<p><b>Buddha:</b> <i>\u201cAnd are there people in Uruvelakappa on whose account sorrow and pain would not arise in you in such an event?\u201d</i></p>\n<p><b>Bhadraka:</b> <i>\u201cYes, venerable sir, there are such people.\u201d</i></p>\n<p><b>Buddha:</b> <i>\u201cWhat is the reason that sorrow and pain arise in relation to some people but not in relation to others?\u201d</i></p>\n<p><b>Bhadraka:</b> <i>\u201cThe ones for whom sorrow and pain would arise in me are those to whom I have attachment.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>Then the Blessed One said:</p>\n<p><b>Whatever suffering arose in the past, whatever suffering will arise in the future, all of it has desire as its root and source; for desire is the cause of suffering.</b></p>\n<p><b>In this way too, headman, it can be understood: \u2018Whatever suffering arises, all of it arises rooted in desire, with desire as its source; for desire is the root of suffering.</b></p>\n<p>Thus, the Buddha guided Bhadraka to recognize the causes of suffering and the way to abandon it.</p>\n<h1>How to Recognize a Good and Wise Person</h1>\n<p>The Buddha frequently advised his followers to associate with the wise and avoid the company of fools. This teaching is beautifully expressed in the opening verse of the <b>Mangala Sutta</b>:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cNot associating with fools,</i></p>\n<p><i>Associating with the wise,</i></p>\n<p><i>Honouring those worthy of honour\u2014</i></p>\n<p><i>This is the highest blessing.\u201d</i> <span id=\"Endnote34\">[<a href=\"#endnote34\">34</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>How to Recognize Wise People</h2>\n<p>The Buddha once gave King Pasenadi of Kosala the following guidance: <span id=\"Endnote35\">[<a href=\"#endnote35\">35</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\u201cGreat king, a person's virtue is known by living with him\u2026</i></p>\n<p><i>His honesty is known through dealings with him\u2026</i></p>\n<p><i>His strength is known in times of misfortune\u2026</i></p>\n<p><i>His wisdom is known through discussion\u2026</i></p>\n<p><i>But this is known only after a long time, not a short time;</i></p>\n<p><i>By one who is attentive, not by one who is inattentive;</i></p>\n<p><i>By one who is wise, not by a fool.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>He further warned:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cA man is not easily known by outward form,</i></p>\n<p><i>Nor should one trust a quick appraisal.</i></p>\n<p><i>For in the guise of the well-controlled,</i></p>\n<p><i>The uncontrolled move about in this world.</i></p>\n<p><i>Like a counterfeit earring made of clay,</i></p>\n<p><i>Like a bronze half-penny coated with gold,</i></p>\n<p><i>Some move about in disguise\u2014</i></p>\n<p><i>Inwardly impure, outwardly beautiful.\u201d</i></p>\n<h2>How to Distinguish Between a Fool and a Wise Person</h2>\n<p>The Buddha provided a clear measure to discern the difference: <span id=\"Endnote36\">[<a href=\"#endnote36\">36</a>]</span>.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\tA <b>fool</b> is one who engages in <b>bodily misconduct, verbal misconduct, and mental misconduct</b>.

His teachings, like a vast and shimmering ocean filled with precious treasures, are adorned with rich and brilliant imagery that clarifies deep and subtle truths.</p>\n<p>With skilful means, the Buddha conveyed the essence of the Dhamma through vivid comparisons, making the profound comprehensible, the abstract tangible, and the distant near. The scriptures abound with these exquisite similes, each like a radiant jewel reflecting the light of wisdom. Here, we present a few, showcasing the Buddha\u2019s extraordinary mastery in using similes to awaken insight and inspire liberation.</p>\n<h1>Similes Illustrating the Length of an Aeon (Kappa)</h1>\n<p>An <b>aeon</b> is an unimaginably vast span of time, extending far beyond ordinary human comprehension. The Buddha, ever intent on guiding beings toward liberation, frequently expounded on the immense suffering endured throughout the endless cycles of sa\u1e43s\u0101ra. Again and again, he urged us to strive for liberation from sensual desires and conditioned existence. To illustrate the staggering length of sa\u1e43s\u0101ra, the Blessed One offered the following profound similes:</p>\n<h2>The Great Stone Mountain</h2>\n<p>Imagine a colossal mountain of solid rock,</p>\n<p>One yojana long (15 km), one yojana wide, and one yojana high.</p>\n<p>Once every hundred years, a man strokes it lightly</p>\n<p>With the finest K\u0101si cloth\u2014soft as a whisper of the wind.</p>\n<p>By this slow and delicate touch, the mountain may one day wear away,</p>\n<p>Vanishing into dust.</p>\n<p>Yet even then, an aeon would not have reached its end! <span id=\"Endnote1\">[<a href=\"#endnote1\">1</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A Large City Filled with Mustard Seeds</h2>\n<p>Imagine a mighty city, encircled by iron walls,</p>\n<p>One yojana long, one yojana wide, and one yojana high.</p>\n<p>Inside, the space is filled\u2014densely packed\u2014</p>\n<p>With mustard seeds, as numerous as the stars in the sky.</p>\n<p>Once every hundred years, a man removes a single seed.</p>\n<p>Slowly, painstakingly, the great heap diminishes,</p>\n<p>Until, at last, not a single mustard seed remains.</p>\n<p>Yet even then, an aeon would not have come to an end! <span id=\"Endnote2\">[<a href=\"#endnote2\">2</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>The Sand in the River Ganges</h2>\n<p>From the sacred source of the Ganges,</p>\n<p>Where its waters first emerge,</p>\n<p>To the place where it merges with the vast ocean\u2014</p>\n<p>Imagine the immeasurable grains of sand</p>\n<p>That line its shores, carried in its currents,</p>\n<p>Stretching beyond sight, beyond reckoning.</p>\n<p>If one were to attempt to count them,</p>\n<p>Even by hundreds, thousands, or hundreds of thousands,</p>\n<p>Still, the aeons that have passed</p>\n<p>Would be even greater in number ! <span id=\"Endnote3\">[<a href=\"#endnote3\">3</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>The Heap of Bones</h2>\n<p>Among the many similes the Blessed One used to illustrate the vast expanse of sa\u1e43s\u0101ra, the following offers a hauntingly powerful image of its unimaginable length:</p>\n<p>The bones left behind by a single being,</p>\n<p>Through the countless births of just one aeon,</p>\n<p>Would amass into a great mountain\u2014</p>\n<p>So declared the Enlightened One.</p>\n<p>This heap of bones would rise as high</p>\n<p>As the towering Vepulla Mountain,</p>\n<p>Standing proudly to the north of Vulture\u2019s Peak,</p>\n<p>Amidst the rugged Magadhan hills. <span id=\"Endnote4\">[<a href=\"#endnote4\">4</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This profound simile reveals the staggering reality of our endless wandering in birth and death. If even a single being leaves behind such a mountain of bones, how much greater is the suffering endured across countless lifetimes? With deep compassion, the Buddha taught this to awaken urgency in our hearts\u2014to inspire us to break free from this unending cycle and seek the path to liberation.</p>\n<h3>A Call to Liberation</h3>\n<p>Through these striking images, the Buddha revealed the unfathomable duration of sa\u1e43s\u0101ra\u2014the endless wandering through birth, aging, and death. In the face of such an immeasurable expanse of suffering, the Blessed One exhorted his disciples to <b>strive diligently for liberation, to break free from the cycle of existence, and to attain the Deathless\u2014Nibb\u0101na.</b></p>\n<p>May these profound similes serve as a reminder of the urgency of the path and inspire all beings to walk the noble way to freedom.</p>\n<h1>Similes Used for Sensual Desires</h1>\n<h2>The Dog and the Bone</h2>\n<p>The Buddha used this simile to illustrate that sensual pleasures can never bring true satisfaction. As long as one remains attached to them, suffering persists, and desires remain unfulfilled. <span id=\"Endnote5\">[<a href=\"#endnote5\">5</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Imagine a hungry dog waiting outside a butcher\u2019s shop. A worker from the shop throws the dog a meatless bone. Overjoyed, the dog licks and bites the bone, hoping to satisfy its hunger. However, the bone contains no meat, offering nothing to fulfill its craving. Still, the dog does not let go. Why? Because it falsely believes that by holding and licking the bone, it will find satisfaction. Lacking wisdom, the dog does not realize that the bone is empty, and in the end, it becomes exhausted and disappointed.</p>\n<p>A noble disciple, however, does not fall into the same delusion. When encountering sensual pleasures, he does not grasp at them blindly. He remembers the Buddha\u2019s teaching:\u00a0<i>Sensual pleasures are like a meatless bone\u2014offering much suffering and despair, while the danger in them is great.</i>\u00a0With wisdom, he sees their true nature and does not become attached.</p>\n<h1>Simile for Good Friendship</h1>\n<p>The Buddha frequently emphasized the importance of good friendship in the spiritual path. The following simile highlights its significance. <span id=\"Endnote6\">[<a href=\"#endnote6\">6</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Just as the dawn is the forerunner of the rising sun, good friendship is the precursor to the arising of the seven factors of enlightenment. When a person associates with a wise friend who follows the Dhamma, he too will gradually develop and cultivate the seven factors of enlightenment. <span id=\"Endnote7\">[<a href=\"#endnote7\">7</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>Simile of the Peaked House</h1>\n<p>The Buddha often used the simile of the peaked house to illustrate profound Dhamma teachings. Imagine a peaked house where all the rafters converge at the roof peak. If the roof peak is removed, the entire structure collapses. This powerful imagery conveys deep insights into the nature of ignorance, Nibb\u0101na, and wisdom.</p>\n<h2>Ignorance as the Roof Peak</h2>\n<p>The peaked house serves as a metaphor for how all unwholesome states are rooted in ignorance. Just as the rafters of a house are connected to the roof peak, all defilements converge upon ignorance. When ignorance is abandoned, all defilements disappear.</p>\n<p><i>\u201cBhikkhus, just as all the rafters of a peaked house lead to the roof peak and join upon it, and all collapse when the roof peak is removed, so too, all unwholesome states are rooted in ignorance and converge upon ignorance. When ignorance is uprooted, all defilements disappear.\u201d </i><span id=\"Endnote8\">[<a href=\"#endnote8\">8</a>]</span><i> </i></p>\n<h2>Nibb\u0101na as the Roof Peak</h2>\n<p>The Buddha likened Nibb\u0101na to the roof peak, emphasizing that the seven factors of enlightenment naturally lead to liberation. Just as all the rafters of a peaked house slant towards the roof peak, a bhikkhu who cultivates the seven factors of enlightenment inclines towards Nibb\u0101na.</p>\n<p><i>\u201cBhikkhus, just as all the rafters of a peaked house slant, slope, and incline towards the roof peak, so too, when a bhikkhu develops and cultivates the seven factors of enlightenment, he slants, slopes, and inclines towards Nibb\u0101na.\u201d </i><span id=\"Endnote9\">[<a href=\"#endnote9\">9</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Wisdom as the Roof Peak</h2>\n<p>Once the roof peak is firmly set in place, the other rafters can be positioned steadily. Similarly, when the faculty of wisdom is established, the other four faculties\u2014faith, energy, mindfulness, and sam\u0101dhi\u2014become stable and well-developed.</p>\n<p><i>\u201cBhikkhus, just as in a house with a peaked roof, there is no stability of the rafters until the roof peak is set in place\u2026 but when the roof peak is secured, the rafters hold firmly, so too, so long as noble knowledge (wisdom) has not arisen in a noble disciple, the other four faculties lack stability. But when noble knowledge has arisen, then the other four faculties become steady and strong.\u201d </i><span id=\"Endnote10\">[<a href=\"#endnote10\">10</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>By deeply contemplating this simile, one gains a clearer understanding of the significance of wisdom, the perils of ignorance, and the inevitable progression towards Nibb\u0101na when the right conditions are cultivated.</p>\n<h1>Similes Illustrating the Growth and Decline in Dhamma</h1>\n<p>The following similes highlight how a moral person flourishes in the Dhamma, while an immoral person declines. <span id=\"Endnote11\">[<a href=\"#endnote11\">11</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>The Tree with Sufficient Branches and the Tree with Deficient Branches</h2>\n<p>The Blessed One said:</p>\n<p><b>\u201cBhikkhus,</b> for an immoral person, one deficient in virtuous conduct, right sam\u0101dhi lacks its proximate cause. Without right sam\u0101dhi, the knowledge and vision of things as they really are cannot arise. Without this knowledge and vision, disenchantment and dispassion fail to develop. Without disenchantment and dispassion, the knowledge and vision of liberation remains unattainable.</p>\n<p>Just as a tree lacking branches and foliage cannot grow to its full potential\u2014its shoots, bark, softwood, and heartwood remaining underdeveloped\u2014so too, an immoral person, deficient in virtue, lacks the necessary conditions for the path to liberation.\u201d</p>\n<p><b>\u201cBhikkhus,</b> for a virtuous person, one established in moral conduct, right sam\u0101dhi finds its necessary support. With right sam\u0101dhi, the knowledge and vision of things as they really are arises. With this knowledge and vision, disenchantment and dispassion develop. With disenchantment and dispassion, the knowledge and vision of liberation is realized.</p>\n<p>Just as a tree rich in branches and foliage grows to its full potential\u2014its shoots, bark, softwood, and heartwood thriving\u2014so too, a virtuous person, grounded in moral conduct, possesses the essential conditions for the path to liberation.\u201d</p>\n<p>(note: the ten fetters (<i>sa\u1e41yojana</i>)\u2014the chains binding them to sa\u1e41s\u0101ra\u2014gradually weaken and fall away. Through morality (<i>s\u012bla</i>), concentration (<i>sam\u0101dhi</i>), and wisdom (<i>pa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101</i>), one purifies the mind, ultimately breaking free from all suffering.</p>\n<h1>How a Noble Person Associates with the Ignorant </h1>\n<p>To illustrate how a Noble One interacts with ignorant people, the Blessed One used the following simile:</p>\n<h2>The Swan and the Milky Water </h2>\n<p>On one occasion, Venerable N\u0101gasam\u0101la was accompanying the Buddha as his attendant. When they reached a crossroads, the Blessed One pointed out the right path and said, \u201cN\u0101gasam\u0101la, this is the way we should go.\u201d However, Venerable N\u0101gasam\u0101la insisted on taking a different route.</p>\n<p>When he went his own way, bandits lying in wait attacked him and broke his alms bowl. Wounded and humbled, he returned to the Buddha and recounted what had happened.</p>\n<p>The Blessed One then uttered this profound Ud\u0101na, likening the wisdom of the Noble Ones to a swan that drinks only the milk when it is mixed with water:</p>\n<p>\u201cWalking together, dwelling as one,</p>\n<p>The Perfect One moves among the ignorant.</p>\n<p>Yet, seeing clearly, he abandons all evil,</p>\n<p>As the milk-drinking swan leaves water behind.\u201d <span id=\"Endnote12\">[<a href=\"#endnote12\">12</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>How to Stop Craving</h1>\n<p>To illustrate how one can put an end to craving, the Buddha used the following simile:</p>\n<h2>Stopping a Flowing River</h2>\n<p>Once, Ajita, a student of the Brahmin B\u0101vari, approached the Buddha and asked how to halt the powerful river of craving.</p>\n<p>The Blessed One explained that just as a flowing river can be stopped by a strong barricade, the torrents of craving can be restrained by mindfulness and wisdom.</p>\n<p><i>\u201cWhatever streams flow through the world,</p>\n<p>Mindfulness is the barrier that holds them back.</p>\n<p>This, I declare, is the way to restrain the streams\u2014</p>\n<p>They are closed off by the power of wisdom.\u201d </i><span id=\"Endnote13\">[<a href=\"#endnote13\">13</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Thus, with mindfulness and wisdom, one can stem the flood of craving and cross to the other shore\u2014free, unshaken, and at peace.</p>\n<h1>The Nature of Existence</h1>\n<p>To illustrate how renewed existence comes to be, the Blessed One used the simile of a seed growing in a field: The Buddha said:</p>\n<p><i>\u201c\u2026\u0100nanda, for beings shrouded in ignorance and bound by craving, kamma is the fertile field, consciousness the seed, and craving the moisture that nurtures its growth. When these conditions are present, consciousness takes root in a new realm\u2014whether inferior or superior\u2014and thus, the cycle of renewed existence continues. In this way, \u0100nanda, existence arises.\u201d</i> <span id=\"Endnote14\">[<a href=\"#endnote14\">14</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Just as a seed, when sown in fertile soil and nourished by water, sprouts and grows, so too does existence continue for those entangled in ignorance and craving.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Power of Heedfulness<b> </b><span id=\"Endnote15\">[<a href=\"#endnote15\">15</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>To emphasize the supreme importance of heedfulness, the Buddha used the following similes, revealing that this single quality, when cultivated, leads to both present and future well-being.</p>\n<h2>The Footprint of an Elephant</h2>\n<p>\u201c\u2026Just as the footprints of all land-dwelling creatures fit within the footprint of an elephant, and the elephant\u2019s footprint surpasses them all in size, so too, heedfulness is the one quality that, when developed and perfected, brings both worldly benefit and ultimate liberation.\u201d <span id=\"Endnote16\">[<a href=\"#endnote16\">16</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As the mighty elephant leaves the deepest and most enduring impression on the earth, heedfulness leaves the greatest impact on one\u2019s journey through sa\u1e43s\u0101ra, shaping both this life and those to come.</p>\n<h2>The Roof Peak of a Peaked House</h2>\n<p>\u201c\u2026Just as all the rafters of a peaked house lean toward its central roof peak, supporting and converging upon it, so too, heedfulness is the single quality upon which all wholesome qualities rest and toward which they incline.\u201d <span id=\"Endnote17\">[<a href=\"#endnote17\">17</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Just as the roof peak holds the structure together, heedfulness is the pinnacle of virtues, supporting and strengthening the path to awakening.</p>\n<h1>The Rarity of Gaining a Human Rebirth</h1>\n<p>The Blessed One frequently emphasized how rare and precious it is to be born in the human realm and to encounter the Dhamma. Through the following similes, he illustrated this profound truth:</p>\n<h2>The Blind Turtle</h2>\n<p>On one occasion, the Buddha asked: <span id=\"Endnote18\">[<a href=\"#endnote18\">18</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cImagine a man were to throw a yoke with a single hole into the vast ocean, and the winds carried it in all directions\u2014east, west, north, and south. Now, suppose there were a blind turtle that surfaced just once at the end of every hundred years. What do you think, bhikkhus? Would that blind turtle ever, by chance, place its neck through that yoke?\u201d</p>\n<p>The bhikkhus replied:</p>\n<p><b>\u201cVenerable sir, perhaps after a very long time, such a thing might happen.\u201d</b></p>\n<p>The Buddha then declared:</p>\n<p><b>\u201cBhikkhus, the blind turtle is more likely to place its neck through the yoke than a fool, once fallen into lower realms, is to regain a human birth. Why is that? Because there is no practice of the Dhamma there.\u201d </b><span id=\"Endnote19\">[<a href=\"#endnote19\">19</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Just as the chances of the turtle finding the yoke are nearly impossible, so too is the opportunity to be reborn as a human after falling into the lower realms\u2014making this life an invaluable chance to practice the Dhamma.</p>\n<h2></h2>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page12/image1.jpeg\" />\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\">A Bit of Soil <span id=\"Endnote20\">[<a href=\"#endnote20\">20</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A Bit of Soil</h2>\n<p>On another occasion, the Buddha took a small pinch of soil on his fingernail and asked:</p>\n<p><b>\u201cBhikkhus, what do you think? Which is greater\u2014the tiny bit of soil on my fingernail or the vast earth?\u201d</b></p>\n<p>The bhikkhus replied:</p>\n<p><b>\u201cVenerable sir, the great earth is far greater.\u201d</b></p>\n<p>The Buddha then explained:</p>\n<p><b>\u201cSo too, bhikkhus, those who, upon passing away from the human realm, are reborn as humans again are few\u2014like the soil on my fingernail. But those who fall into lower realms are as vast as the earth itself.\u201d </b><i>\u2026\u201d</i><span id=\"Endnote21\">[<a href=\"#endnote21\">21</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This rare human birth should not be taken for granted, for it is the gateway to liberation.</p>\n<h1>The Urgency of Abandoning Identity View (Sakk\u0101yadi\u1e6d\u1e6dhi)</h1>\n<p>To emphasize the importance of abandoning identity view, the Buddha used the following powerful similes:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cIf a person were struck with a sword, he would rush for treatment to save his life. Likewise, if one\u2019s clothes caught fire, one would immediately throw them off to avoid being burned.</i></p>\n<p><i>In the same way, one walking the path to liberation must act swiftly to uproot identity view and strive to attain stream-entry without delay.\u201d</i> <span id=\"Endnote22\">[<a href=\"#endnote22\">22</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Just as we would not hesitate to remove burning clothes or seek aid for a mortal wound, we must make haste in cutting through delusion\u2014before this precious opportunity slips away.</p>\n<h1>The Perils of Ungratefulness and Lack of Mindfulness</h1>\n<h2>Ungratefulness\u2014A Mark of Low Character</h2>\n<p>Ungratefulness is a quality that stains the heart, obscuring the virtues of humility and wisdom. Like a tree that bears no fruit despite being nurtured, an ungrateful person fails to appreciate the kindness that sustains them. The Buddha, in his boundless compassion, warned of the dangers of ingratitude with a striking simile:<i> </i><span id=\"Endnote23\">[<a href=\"#endnote23\">23</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>The Jackal</h3>\n<p>A jackal, known for its cunning and opportunistic nature, may still retain a sense of gratitude when it finds food or shelter. Yet, the Blessed One pointed out that an ungrateful monk\u2014one who fails to appreciate the profound gifts of the Dhamma and the kindness of others\u2014sinks even lower than a jackal:</p>\n<p><b>\u201cThere may be some gratitude and thankfulness in that old jackal, but there is no gratitude and thankfulness in a certain person here claiming to be a follower of the Sakyan son\u2026 Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: \u2018We will be grateful and thankful, and we will not overlook even the least Favor done to us.\u2019\u201d</b></p>\n<p>Gratitude is the mark of a noble heart. It is not merely a pleasant emotion but a force that uplifts the mind, deepens wisdom, and fortifies virtue. Just as a river nourishes the land it touches, gratitude enriches the mind, fostering contentment and joy. A person who cherishes even the smallest act of kindness blossoms with inner beauty and strength.</p>\n<p>An ungrateful heart, however, is like a cracked vessel\u2014it cannot hold the waters of wisdom. No matter how much guidance and support it receives, it remains empty. A monk who forgets the kindness of his teachers, supporters, and the immeasurable gift of the Dhamma risks falling into arrogance and heedlessness, straying far from the path to liberation.</p>\n<p>Thus, the wise remember: gratitude is not a burden, but a blessing; not an obligation, but a source of great merit.</p>\n<h2>The Danger of Carelessness in Mindfulness</h2>\n<p>The Buddha also cautioned against the dangers of heedlessness, for a moment of carelessness can undo years of effort. Just as a single spark can ignite a forest fire, a single lapse in mindfulness can give rise to unwholesome thoughts that consume the mind. To illustrate this, the Blessed One gave a powerful simile:</p>\n<h3>The Cat Who Swallowed a Mouse</h3>\n<p>A greedy cat, upon catching a mouse, swallows it whole, eager to devour its prey. Yet, because it fails to chew, the mouse remains alive inside its stomach. Gnawing from within, the mouse eventually kills the cat.</p>\n<p>In the same way, a monk who enters a village for alms without mindfulness is like the cat. If he allows his senses to wander and encounters a woman dressed lightly, lust may arise in his heart. Though subtle at first, unchecked desire gnaws at his resolve, weakening his determination. If he does not guard his mind, this poison will spread, leading him away from the holy life and blocking the path to the cessation of suffering.</p>\n<p><b>\u201cTherefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: \u2018We will enter a village or town for alms with body, speech, and mind guarded, with mindfulness set up, restrained in our sense faculties.\u2019 </b><span id=\"Endnote24\">[<a href=\"#endnote24\">24</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mindfulness is the gatekeeper of wisdom, the guardian of the heart. Just as a wise king places trusted sentinels at the gates of his city, a monk places mindfulness at the doors of his senses. With mindfulness established, sights, sounds, and sensations pass through without disturbing the mind, just as a lotus remains unstained by the water in which it grows.</p>\n<p>Heedlessness, however, is the enemy of progress. A single unguarded moment can lead to downfall, just as a charioteer who loosens his grip on the reins loses control of his horses. But the one who remains ever watchful, who walks with mindfulness and restraint, will find peace unshaken\u2014like a mountain standing firm amidst the winds of the world.</p>\n<p><b>\u201cTherefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: \u2018We will enter a village or town for alms with body, speech, and mind guarded, with mindfulness set up, restrained in our sense faculties.\u2019\u201d</b></p>\n<p>Mindfulness is the guardian of the heart, the shield against defilements. Like a vigilant watchman protecting a city from intruders, a mindful monk safeguards his senses, ensuring that no unwholesome thoughts take root. With unwavering awareness, he walks the path to true peace and freedom.</p>\n<h2>A Life of Gratitude and Mindfulness</h2>\n<p>Thus, the Blessed One exhorted his disciples to cultivate both gratitude and mindfulness, for these qualities protect and uplift the heart. Gratitude nourishes wisdom, ensuring that one walks the path with humility and reverence. Mindfulness strengthens resolve, shielding the mind from defilements and distractions.</p>\n<p>Just as the sun and moon illuminate the sky, gratitude and mindfulness illuminate the path to liberation. Those who cherish these qualities walk with joy, their hearts radiant with the light of the Dhamma, ever moving toward the shore of Nibb\u0101na.</p>\n<h1>The Power of Kamma\u2014The Inescapable Law of Cause and Effect</h1>\n<p>The Buddha, with his perfect wisdom, revealed that all beings are the heirs of their actions. Just as a seed sown in fertile soil will inevitably bear fruit, every deed\u2014whether wholesome or unwholesome\u2014produces corresponding results. Through vivid similes, the Blessed One illuminated the workings of kamma, teaching that skilful actions lead to happiness and unskilful actions lead to suffering.</p>\n<h2>The Inescapable Consequence of Wrongdoing</h2>\n<h3>Wronging the Innocent Brings One\u2019s Own Ruin</h3>\n<p>The Buddha used a striking simile to illustrate the inevitable repercussions of harming the pure and innocent. Just as dust thrown into the air ultimately falls back upon the one who casts it, an evil deed done to a faultless person will return to its doer with inescapable force:</p>\n<p><b>\u201cIf one wrongs an innocent man,</p>\n<p>A pure person without blemish,</p>\n<p>The evil falls back on the fool himself</p>\n<p>Like fine dust thrown against the wind.\u201d </b><span id=\"Endnote25\">[<a href=\"#endnote25\">25</a>]</span><b> </b></p>\n<p>This profound truth reminds us that cruelty, deceit, and injustice can never truly harm the virtuous. Even if the innocent suffers temporarily, their purity protects them in the long run, while those who commit wrongdoings inevitably suffer their own downfall.</p>\n<p>Hatred, malice, and envy are like fiery embers held in one\u2019s own hand\u2014though they may be intended for another, they first burn the one who carries them. Thus, the wise refrain from harming others, knowing that every action, word, and thought will return, like a shadow that never leaves.</p>\n<h2>Kamma\u2014The Sure Fruits of One\u2019s Deeds</h2>\n<h3>Every Action Brings Its Due Result</h3>\n<p>The Buddha further emphasized the certainty of kamma through another powerful analogy found in the <i>Dhammapada</i>. He revealed that just as an ox pulling a cart cannot escape the weight of its burden, so too a person cannot evade the results of their own deeds: <span id=\"Endnote26\">[<a href=\"#endnote26\">26</a>]</span></p>\n<p><b>\u201cIf a person does evil, the fruit of that evil follows him,</p>\n<p>Like the cart-wheel follows the foot of the ox.\u201d</b></p>\n<p>In the same way that the ox cannot shake off the cart that it drags, a person who has done wrong cannot escape the consequences of their misdeeds. Even if the results do not manifest immediately, they remain bound to the doer, awaiting their time to ripen.</p>\n<p>Yet, the Buddha also offered a reassuring truth\u2014wholesome actions bear results just as surely as unwholesome ones:</p>\n<p><b>\u201cIf a person does good, the fruit of that goodness follows him,</p>\n<p>Like a shadow that never leaves.\u201d</b></p>\n<p>Just as a shadow cling to a person, wholesome kamma remains with the doer, bringing peace, joy, and future well-being. A person who cultivates generosity, virtue, and wisdom need not fear the future, for they walk upon a path of safety and light.</p>\n<h2>The Path to Liberation\u2014Choosing One\u2019s Destiny</h2>\n<p>Understanding the law of kamma inspires both caution and confidence. It teaches caution because harmful deeds, even if done in secrecy, will bear fruit in due time. And it inspires confidence because good deeds, even if unseen by others, will never be lost.</p>\n<p>Thus, the wise carefully guard their actions, knowing that each thought, word, and deed shapes their future. By cultivating generosity, virtue, and wisdom, they sow seeds of happiness that will ripen into joy, peace, and ultimately, liberation.</p>\n<p>Just as a farmer carefully tends to his crops, ensuring a rich harvest, one who cultivates skilful actions secures a future of unshakable well-being. And just as fire burns those who play with it carelessly, one who indulges in unwholesome deeds will surely face suffering.</p>\n<p>Thus, the Blessed One declared:</p>\n<p><b>\u201cBy oneself is evil done; by oneself is one defiled.</p>\n<p>By oneself is evil left undone; by oneself is one purified.</p>\n<p>Purity and impurity depend on oneself\u2014</p>\n<p>No one can purify another.\u201d</b> <span id=\"Endnote27\">[<a href=\"#endnote27\">27</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>May we all strive to walk the path of wisdom and goodness, ensuring a future free from suffering and filled with boundless peace.</p>\n<h1><b>Loving-Kindness (</b><b><i>Mett\u0101</i></b><b>)\u2014An Unshakable Heart</b></h1>\n<p>The Buddha frequently emphasized the boundless power of <i>mett\u0101</i> (loving-kindness), encouraging his followers to cultivate this sublime quality to attain great benefits and profound spiritual fruits. Just as a radiant sun dispels darkness effortlessly, a mind suffused with <i>mett\u0101</i> remains unshaken by the unskilful actions of others.</p>\n<p>Through vivid similes, the Blessed One illustrated the immeasurable strength of a heart filled with unconditional loving-kindness. When one develops limitless <i>mett\u0101</i>, no harm, insult, or ill will can disturb the mind\u2014just as the vast earth, boundless space, and a well-rubbed catskin bag remain unaffected by external forces.</p>\n<h2>Be Like the Earth\u2014Vast, Unshaken, and Impartial</h2>\n<p>The earth is vast and all-sustaining. It bears the weight of all beings, whether good or evil, without complaint. People may dig into it, trample upon it, or cast filth upon it, yet the earth remains unmoved.</p>\n<p>The Buddha gave this simile to illustrate the unshakable nature of <i>mett\u0101</i>: <span id=\"Endnote28\">[<a href=\"#endnote28\">28</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>\"Suppose a person came with a hoe, intending to remove all the earth into the basket he carries. No matter how much he tries, he cannot unearth the entire ground.\"</b></p>\n<p>In the same way, when a person has cultivated boundless <i>mett\u0101</i>, the harsh words and actions of others will not disturb them. Just as the earth does not recoil in anger when someone spits upon it, a loving heart does not react with hatred when faced with hostility.</p>\n<p>A person who has fully developed <i>mett\u0101</i> is like a great mountain\u2014unmoved by the winds of praise or blame. They respond to aggression with understanding, to cruelty with compassion, and to hostility with peace.</p>\n<h2>Be Like Space\u2014Unstained and Beyond Defilement</h2>\n<p>Space is vast, formless, and ungraspable. No matter how much dust is thrown into the air, space remains untouched. A person may bring a palette of colours, wishing to paint pictures upon space, but it is impossible\u2014space cannot be tainted.</p>\n<p>Likewise, the Buddha taught:</p>\n<p><b>\"Suppose a person came with many colours of paint and tried to decorate space. No matter how hard he tries, he cannot alter or stain it.\" </b><span id=\"Endnote29\">[<a href=\"#endnote29\">29</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Just as space remains pure and open, a heart filled with <i>mett\u0101</i> cannot be stained by hatred, anger, or resentment. Even if others try to provoke or harm, the practitioner of <i>mett\u0101</i> remains free\u2014unaffected by the impurities of the world.</p>\n<p>This simile reminds us that external conditions do not determine our peace; rather, it is the state of our mind that shapes our experience. A mind rooted in loving-kindness is like an open sky\u2014boundless, free, and beyond defilement.</p>\n<h2>Be Like a Well-Rubbed Catskin Bag\u2014Soft, Resilient, and Unbreakable</h2>\n<p>The Buddha used another striking simile to describe the resilience of a mind steeped in <i>mett\u0101</i>:</p>\n<p><b>\"A well-rubbed catskin bag does not crack or tear, no matter how much one tries to break it with a stick.\" </b><span id=\"Endnote30\">[<a href=\"#endnote30\">30</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A heart trained in <i>mett\u0101</i> is supple and unbreakable, like well-tanned leather that resists wear and tear. Even under pressure, it does not rupture. Likewise, when one cultivates loving-kindness deeply, even the harshest treatment from others cannot damage their inner peace.</p>\n<p>This simile teaches us that <i>mett\u0101</i> is not just gentleness\u2014it is also strength. It is not passivity, but an unshakable resilience in the face of harm. Just as water remains fluid and yielding yet wears down even the hardest rock, a loving heart is soft yet indomitable.</p>\n<h2>The Boundless Power of <i>Mett\u0101</i></h2>\n<p>When one cultivates limitless <i>mett\u0101</i>, the mind becomes vast like the earth, free like space, and resilient like a well-rubbed catskin bag. No matter what challenges arise, they do not disturb the heart.</p>\n<p>A person who embodies <i>mett\u0101</i> walks through the world with fearlessness and grace. They neither cling to praise nor recoil from blame. They radiate goodwill even toward those who seek to harm them, for they understand the truth: hatred only ceases through love, not through more hatred.</p>\n<p>The Buddha declared:</p>\n<p><b>\u201cHatred is never overcome by hatred, but by love alone\u2014this is an eternal law.\u201d</b> <span id=\"Endnote31\">[<a href=\"#endnote31\">31</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Thus, the practice of <i>mett\u0101</i> is not just an act of kindness\u2014it is a path to liberation. It purifies the mind, dissolves ill will, and leads to deep inner peace. Those who walk this path attain great blessings, for they dwell in harmony with the Dhamma, unshaken by the storms of the world.</p>\n<h3>May All Beings Be Happy! </h3>\n<p>May we all cultivate boundless <i>mett\u0101</i>, embracing all beings with goodwill and compassion. May we become like the earth\u2014patient and unwavering; like space\u2014vast and undefiled; and like a well-rubbed catskin bag\u2014soft yet indestructible.</p>\n<p>In doing so, may we find unshakable peace and walk the noble path to liberation.</p>\n<h1>The Mind\u2014The Key to Liberation</h1>\n<p>The Buddha often emphasized that the mind is the source of both suffering and liberation. When the mind is untrained, it wavers like a flickering flame in the wind, easily disturbed by desires, aversions, and distractions. But when properly cultivated, the mind becomes unshakable\u2014firm like a mountain, clear like a polished mirror, and steady like the deep ocean.</p>\n<p>For one walking the spiritual path, strengthening the mind is essential. It requires a solid foundation, just as a structure needs a firm base to stand strong. Through illuminating similes, the Buddha revealed the nature of a trained mind and the obstacles that cloud its clarity.</p>\n<h2>The Mind Needs a Strong Foundation</h2>\n<h3>The Pot and Its Stand</h3>\n<p>The Buddha compared the mind to a pot and the Noble Eightfold Path to its stand: <span id=\"Endnote32\">[<a href=\"#endnote32\">32</a>]</span></p>\n<p><b>\u201cJust as a pot without a stand is easily knocked over, while one with a stand is difficult to knock over, so the mind without a stand is easily knocked over, while the mind with a stand is difficult to knock over.\u201d</b></p>\n<p>A pot without a firm base can be tipped over with the slightest touch. Similarly, a mind without a stable foundation is easily disturbed by worldly conditions\u2014praise and blame, gain and loss, pleasure and pain.</p>\n<p>But what provides stability to the mind? It is the Noble Eightfold Path:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\t<b>Right View</b> gives wisdom, helping one see the world as it truly is.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\t<b>Right Intention</b> directs the mind toward renunciation, goodwill, and harmlessness.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\t<b>Right Speech, Right Action, and Right Livelihood</b> provide moral discipline, creating a life free of regret.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\t<b>Right Effort, Right Mindfulness, and Right Concentration</b> develop mental strength, making the mind unshakable.</p>\n<p>A practitioner who establishes their mind on this path stands firm amidst the storms of life. No matter how strong the winds of suffering blow, they remain unmoved\u2014rooted in wisdom and virtue.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Five Hindrances\u2014Clouding the Mind\u2019s Clarity<b> </b><span id=\"Endnote33\">[<a href=\"#endnote33\">33</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>To cultivate a strong and peaceful mind, one must first remove the five hindrances (<i>pa\u00f1ca n\u012bvara\u1e47\u0101</i>), which obstruct insight and inner stillness. The Buddha used powerful similes to illustrate how these mental defilements distort perception, preventing one from seeing reality clearly.</p>\n<p>1\ufe0f <b>Sensual Desire\u2014A Bowl of Coloured Water</b></p>\n<p><i>\"Just as one cannot see their reflection in a bowl of water mixed with bright colors, a mind clouded by sensual desire cannot perceive the truth.\"</i></p>\n<p>When the mind is entangled in craving\u2014whether for pleasures of the senses, material possessions, or worldly attachments\u2014it becomes distorted, seeing only what it wants to see. Like dyed water, which alters the appearance of what is submerged in it, sensual desire colors perception, leading to delusion.</p>\n<p>To overcome this, the Buddha encouraged <i>sense restraint</i> and the contemplation of impermanence, recognizing that all pleasures are fleeting and cannot bring lasting satisfaction.</p>\n<p>2\ufe0f <b>Ill Will\u2014A Bowl of Bubbling, Boiling Water</b></p>\n<p><i>\"Just as one cannot see their reflection in a bowl of water bubbling with heat, a mind inflamed with anger cannot perceive the truth.\"</i></p>\n<p>Hatred and resentment generate turbulence in the mind, making it restless and agitated. Like boiling water that distorts everything reflected in it, anger skews perception, causing one to see enemies where there are none and to exaggerate faults in others.</p>\n<p>The antidote to ill will is the cultivation of <i>mett\u0101</i> (loving-kindness), which softens the heart and brings peace.</p>\n<p>3\ufe0f <b>Dullness and Drowsiness\u2014A Bowl of Water Covered in Weeds</b></p>\n<p><i>\"Just as one cannot see their reflection in water covered with algae and weeds, a mind clouded by dullness cannot perceive the truth.\"</i></p>\n<p>Sloth and torpor weigh down the mind, making it sluggish and unresponsive. When drowsiness takes over, wisdom fades, and the mind sinks into lethargy\u2014like a pond choked with vegetation, where no light can penetrate.</p>\n<p>To dispel dullness, one must cultivate <i>energy</i> (<i>viriya</i>), practice mindfulness, and engage in contemplation of death (<i>mara\u1e47asati</i>), which awakens a sense of urgency on the path.</p>\n<p>4\ufe0f <b>Restlessness and Remorse\u2014A Bowl of Water Stirred by the Wind</b></p>\n<p><i>\"Just as one cannot see their reflection in water disturbed by the wind, a mind afflicted with restlessness cannot perceive the truth.\"</i></p>\n<p>When the mind is restless\u2014constantly worrying about the past, anxious about the future, or caught in distractions\u2014it lacks stability. Like water stirred by the wind, it cannot settle, making concentration impossible.</p>\n<p>To calm restlessness, one must develop <i>sam\u0101dhi</i> (mental stillness) through meditation, particularly <i>\u0101n\u0101p\u0101nasati</i> (mindfulness of breathing), which anchors the mind in the present moment.</p>\n<p>5\ufe0f <b>Doubt\u2014A Bowl of Muddy Water</b></p>\n<p><i>\"Just as one cannot see their reflection in water made thick with mud, a mind clouded by doubt cannot perceive the truth.\"</i></p>\n<p>Doubt arises when one lacks confidence in the path, the Dhamma, or one\u2019s own abilities. It leads to hesitation and confusion, preventing progress. Just as mud obscures the water\u2019s clarity, doubt prevents the mind from seeing clearly.</p>\n<p>To overcome doubt, one must cultivate <i>wisdom</i> (<i>pa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101</i>), reflect on the teachings, and seek guidance from wise and noble friends (<i>kaly\u0101\u1e47amitta</i>).</p>\n<h2>The Path to a Clear and Unshakable Mind</h2>\n<p>Just as a lake must be free from colour, heat, weeds, wind, and mud to reflect a clear image, the mind must be free from sensual desire, ill will, dullness, restlessness, and doubt to see the truth.</p>\n<p>When the five hindrances are removed, the mind becomes like a still, clear pool\u2014able to reflect reality as it is. In this state, one develops deep concentration, insight, and ultimately, liberation.</p>\n<p>The Buddha declared:</p>\n<p><b>\"The mind is luminous, but it is defiled by passing impurities. When these impurities are removed, the mind shines brilliantly.\"</b> <span id=\"Endnote34\">[<a href=\"#endnote34\">34</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Thus, by cultivating a strong foundation in the Noble Eightfold Path and removing the five hindrances, one attains a mind that is steadfast, peaceful, and radiant\u2014leading to the highest happiness, Nibb\u0101na.</p>\n<h3>May We All Attain the Strength of a Clear and Still Mind</h3>\n<p>May we develop unwavering mindfulness, purify the mind from all hindrances, and walk firmly upon the path to liberation. May we train our minds to be like a well-supported pot\u2014unshakable, strong, and rooted in wisdom.</p>\n<h1>The Supreme Purity of the Buddha</h1>\n<p>The Buddha, the perfectly enlightened one, is the embodiment of purity, wisdom, and compassion. Having transcended all defilements, he stands radiant and untainted\u2014like a lotus in full bloom, rising above the waters of the world.</p>\n<h2>The Simile of the Lotus Flower</h2>\n<p>The lotus is a powerful symbol of spiritual awakening. Though it is born in the mud and grows in the water, it rises above both, untouched and unsoiled, unfolding its delicate petals in pristine beauty.</p>\n<p>Likewise, the Buddha was born into this world\u2014a world filled with greed, hatred, and delusion. Yet, through his supreme awakening (<i>Sambodhi</i>), he rose above all impurities, completely free from defilements. His wisdom and compassion, vast and boundless, illuminate the world like a fully blossomed lotus, untouched by the stains of suffering.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page12/image2.jpeg\" />\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>The Buddha standing radiant and untainted, like a lotus in full bloom, rising above the waters of the world </b><span id=\"Endnote35\">[<a href=\"#endnote35\">35</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\u201cJust as a beautiful white lotus,</i> <i></p>\n<p>Untouched by the water, remains pure,</p>\n<p>So too, I am not soiled by the world.</p>\n<p>Therefore, O Brahmin, I am a Buddha.\u201d </i><span id=\"Endnote36\">[<a href=\"#endnote36\">36</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>His mind, free from attachment and aversion, remains ever-luminous.

Like a guiding light in the darkness, it illuminates the way for those who seek freedom from the endless cycle of birth and death.</p>\n<p>The Buddha often used vivid similes to illustrate how one who earnestly cultivates this path is inevitably drawn toward liberation, just as natural forces always move toward their destined course.

Just as a tree flourish when its roots are deep and strong, so too does a practitioner thrive when their life is firmly rooted in ethical conduct.</p>\n<p>Virtue is not a restriction; it is a liberation.

Based on information from the Tipi\u1e6daka, it is challenging to reconstruct an unbroken sequence of events from the years he spent proclaiming the Dhamma for the happiness and welfare of many. Therefore, we have compiled key events from this period into a series of subsections, each focusing on significant aspects of his life and teachings. These subsections will include important Dhamma messages and sermons, milestones in the expansion of his dispensation, his extensive walking tours, the locations where he spent the rainy seasons (vassa), and other noteworthy events.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page13/image1.jpeg\" />\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>The Buddha the Fully Enlightened One </b><span id=\"Endnote1\">[<a href=\"#endnote1\">1</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>Vassa (the Rainy Season Retreat)</h1>\n<p>Vassa refers to the three- to four-month rainy season in ancient India, during which members of various religious sects would retreat into forests and hermitages for seclusion, ceasing their travels. During this time, their lay followers provided them with essential food and other necessities. The Buddha endorsed this longstanding tradition and encouraged his disciples to observe Vassa in a peaceful and disciplined manner. The rules for observing Vassa are explained in detail in the Vinaya Pi\u1e6daka.</p>\n<h1>Age of 35 to 80 years</h1>\n<p>This series covers the period from the Buddha\u2019s enlightenment (<i>Sambodhi</i>) at the age of thirty-five to his passing (<i>Parinibb\u0101na</i>) at the age of eighty. According to scriptures and tradition, the Blessed One, guided by his boundless compassion (<i>mah\u0101karu\u1e47\u0101</i>) and loving-kindness (<i>mett\u0101</i>), travelled tirelessly from village to village, town to town, and province to province across the northern and eastern regions of ancient India (then known as <i>Jambud\u012bpa</i>). He delivered sermons, offered advice, and provided guidance to people from all walks of life\u2014kings, ministers, householders, wealthy merchants, the poor, including beggars, as well as criminals such as robbers. Regardless of caste or status, he showed all the path to liberation.</p>\n<h2>Major States of Ancient India During the Time of the Buddha</h2>\n<p>During his missionary journey, the Blessed One travelled extensively across most of the sixteen great provinces (then called <i>Mah\u0101janapadas</i>) of ancient northern India. To better understand the historical context, it is helpful to refer to a modern map based on scriptures and ancient texts. The map below highlights the major provinces (or kingdoms) and important cities that existed before and during the time of the Buddha. Below, we have compiled information about these regions from scriptures and other sources.</p>\n<h3>Other sources:</h3>\n<p>The <b>Mah\u0101janapadas </b>(solosa janapadas- see the map below) were sixteen kingdoms and aristocratic republics that existed in Ancient India from the sixth to fourth centuries of BCE\u2026Two of the Mah\u0101janapadas were most probably\u00a0<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ga%E1%B9%87asa%E1%B9%85gha\"><i><u>ga\u1e47asa\u1e45gha</u></i></p>\n<p><u>s</u></a>\u00a0(aristocratic republics), and others had forms of monarchy.

Beyond it lay the city of <i>Mah\u0101s\u0101l\u0101</i>, and further east were the outer boundary regions of the Middle Country.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\tSoutheastern Corner: The <i>Sallavat\u012b</i> River marked the southeastern boundary. Beyond this river, the territory extended into regions outside <i>Majjhimadesa</i>.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\tSouthern Boundary: In the south, the town of <i>Setaka\u1e47\u1e47ika</i> was the last settlement within the Middle Country.

Beyond this mountainous region lay the territories outside <i>Majjhimadesa</i>.</p>\n<p>These boundaries defined the region in which the Buddha primarily travelled and taught, a land considered sacred as the birthplace of enlightened beings and the cradle of the Dhamma. <span id=\"Endnote10\">[<a href=\"#endnote10\">10</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Ancient Kaja\u1e45gal\u0101 a market town situated 100 km south east of City of Champa and 80 km from city of Bhaddiya : current name is Kankjol, a small village in Sahibganji district in Jharkhand, it situated 18 km south of Rajmahal (a subdivisional town of the Sahebganj district) right on the Indo-Bangladesh border. The Indriyabh\u0101van\u0101 Sutta (MN:152) also mentions that on one occasion the Buddha was staying Kajangal\u0101 in a grove of mukhelu trees. In AN10:27 sutta mentioned an event occurred during the time of the Buddha was dwelling in Kaja\u1e45gal\u0101, Bhikkhuni Kaja\u1e45gal\u0101, delivering a discourse to some lay people from that place.

Out of deep gratitude, he first thought of his former teachers, <b>\u0100\u1e37\u0101ra K\u0101l\u0101ma and Uddaka R\u0101maputta</b>, <span id=\"Endnote4\">[<a href=\"#endnote4\">4</a>]</span>  knowing they possessed great wisdom and would readily grasp the Dhamma.

The Buddha himself emphasized that merely grasping the Four Noble Truths can transform one\u2019s destiny, ensuring a meaningful, joyful life and a fortunate rebirth:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cBhikkhus, those beings are few who, when they pass away as humans,</p>\n<p>are reborn again among humans.

According to scriptures and tradition, the Buddha spent his first vassa at Barnas, Isipatana, the sacred Deer Park, together with his first five disciples. <span id=\"Endnote52\">[<a href=\"#endnote52\">52</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>Evidence regarding the first vassa</h1>\n<p>The Vinaya Pi\u1e6daka confirms this important event, marking the first monastic retreat in the Buddha\u2019s dispensation. This retreat was not merely a time of residence but a period of<b><i> </i></b>profound transformation, as new disciples were drawn to the Blessed One\u2019s teachings. Following two events confirmed that the Blessed One spend his first vassa at Barnas, Isipatana.</p>\n<h3>1) The Meeting with Yasa \u2013 The Sixth Arahant <span id=\"Endnote53\">[<a href=\"#endnote53\">53</a>]</span></h3>\n<p>One of the most significant events during this first vassa was the encounter between the Buddha and Yasa, the son of a wealthy family from B\u0101r\u0101\u1e47as\u012b. The Vinaya Pi\u1e6daka provides a vivid account of Yasa\u2019s awakening:</p>\n<p><i>\u201c\u2026 While Yasa was spending the four months of the rainy season in the rainy-season house, he fell asleep before his attendants. When he awoke, he saw them still asleep, lying in disarray, and it appeared to him like a charnel ground before his very eyes. Overcome with a deep sense of repulsion, a feeling of renunciation arose in him\u2026\u201d</i></p>\n<p>Realizing the impermanence of worldly pleasures, Yasa left his home and wandered through the night, arriving at Isipatana, where he encountered the Buddha. The Blessed One, with his boundless wisdom and compassion, preached the Dhamma to Yasa, revealing the truth of suffering and the path to liberation.</p>\n<p>Upon hearing the sublime teaching, Yasa was deeply moved and became a disciple of the Buddha.  <span id=\"Endnote54\">[<a href=\"#endnote54\">54</a>]</span> Soon after, through diligent practice, he attained Arahantship, becoming the sixth fully enlightened disciple in the world.</p>\n<p>This moment demonstrated the timeless power of the Dhamma\u2014how even one glimpse of impermanence (anicca) could awaken a sincere seeker, leading them from worldly disillusionment to the path of liberation. <span id=\"Endnote55\">[<a href=\"#endnote55\">55</a>]</span></p>\n<h3>2) The Buddha\u2019s Reflection at the End of the First Vassa</h3>\n<p>Upon completing his first Rainy Season Retreat, the Blessed One gathered the monks and spoke these profound words recorded in the Vinaya Pi\u1e6daka:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cThrough wise attention and wise right effort, I have reached the supreme freedom, realized the supreme freedom. And you, monks, have done the same.\u201d </i><span id=\"Endnote56\">[<a href=\"#endnote56\">56</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>These words hold deep significance. They remind us that liberation is not granted by another\u2014it is realized through one\u2019s own effort, wisdom, and practice. The monastic retreat (Vassa) was not simply a period of rest but a time of intense practice, insight, and realization.</p>\n<p>The both events mentioned in the scriptures as stated above confirm that the Buddha spent his first rainy season in Deer Park, Isipatana.</p>\n<h1>Other Testimonies of the Buddha\u2019s First Vassa</h1>\n<p>Various sources provide further insights into the spiritual impact of this period:</p>\n<p>1\ufe0f A Verse from the Commentaries:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cAfter setting the Wheel of the Dhamma rolling at Isipatana, he made 180 million Brahmas and Devas imbibe the immortal ambrosia During his first Rains Retreat.\u201d <span id=\"Endnote57\">[<a href=\"#endnote57\">57</a>]</span>.</p>\n<p><i>( Pa\u1e6dhama\u1e41 Vassa\u1e41 Isipatane Dhammacakka\u1e41 pavattetv\u0101</i></p>\n<p><i>a\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101rasa Brahmako\u1e6diyo amatap\u0101na\u1e41 p\u0101yetv\u0101).</i></p>\n<p>This reveals that the Dhamma was not confined to the human world alone\u2014it reverberated across the cosmos, reaching even the highest realms. The Brahmas, celestial beings of great virtue, rejoiced and were deeply moved by the Buddha\u2019s teachings.</p>\n<p>2\ufe0f A Poetic Description of the Buddha\u2019s Presence at Isipatana:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cThe Excellent, Victorious (Buddha) Sun,</p>\n<p>Illuminated those who were receptive\u2014like a lotus field opening to the morning light\u2014</p>\n<p>With the radiant beams of the True Dhamma,</p>\n<p>While dwelling for the first Rains Retreat in the Deer Park near B\u0101r\u0101\u1e47as\u012b.\u201d <span id=\"Endnote58\">[<a href=\"#endnote58\">58</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>(<i>Pavaro Jina-a\u1e41su-m\u0101li Saddhamma-ra\u1e41si-nikarehi veneyya-pa\u1e45kaja-van\u0101ni vik\u0101sayanto, pa\u1e6dhamamhi Vasse, B\u0101r\u0101\u1e47asimhi nagare Miga-K\u0101nanamhi v\u0101sa\u1e41 ak\u0101si.) </i></p>\n<p>This imagery conveys the Buddha\u2019s presence as a radiant sun, awakening those ready to receive the Dhamma.

During this profound period, he delivered two of the most revolutionary discourses in history: the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta and the Anattalakkha\u1e47a Sutta, setting the Wheel of Dhamma in motion and revealing the nature of non-self.</p>\n<p>The Blessed One then spent his first Rains Retreat (Vassa) at Isipatana, deepening his disciples' understanding of the path.</p>\n<p>Now, we turn to the next phase of the Buddha\u2019s mission\u2014the Second and Third Walking Tours, during which he expanded his teachings further, met King Bimbis\u0101ra, and witnessed significant events that shaped the early Sangha.</p>\n<h2>The Second Walking Tour: From Isipatana to Uruvel\u0101</h2>\n<p>At the end of the first Vassa, the Buddha instructed his sixty arahant disciples to go forth into the world and spread the Dhamma:</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Go forth, monks, for the welfare and happiness of many, out of compassion for the world\u2026 There are beings with little dust in their eyes who are wasting away because they have not heard the Dhamma.

His compassion led him toward Uruvel\u0101, where he would continue to proclaim the liberating Truth:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cI too will go to Uruvel\u0101, to Sen\u0101nigama, to proclaim the Teaching.\u201d </i><span id=\"Endnote2\">[<a href=\"#endnote2\">2</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This journey was not merely a physical one\u2014it symbolized the Buddha\u2019s unwavering determination to seek out those who had the potential for awakening. In Uruvel\u0101, momentous encounters awaited him, including his meeting with King Bimbis\u0101ra, a ruler whose destiny was intertwined with the Dhamma.</p>\n<p>In the next segment, we will explore these meetings and the profound impact they had on the spread of the Buddha\u2019s teachings.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page13_2/image1.png\" />\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>Second Walking Tour of the Buddha- From Isipatana to Uruvel\u0101 </b><span id=\"Endnote3\">[<a href=\"#endnote3\">3</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page13_2/image2.png\" />\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>Modern day map: distance from Varanasi to Gaya: about 248 km. </b><span id=\"Endnote4\">[<a href=\"#endnote4\">4</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page13_2/image3.png\" />\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>The Buddha walking along through woodlands of Benares towards Uruvel\u0101 </b><span id=\"Endnote5\">[<a href=\"#endnote5\">5</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Insights from Other Sources on the Second Walking Tour <span id=\"Endnote6\">[<a href=\"#endnote6\">6</a>]</span> </h2>\n<p>After spending his first Rains Retreat (Vassa) at Isipatana, Migad\u0101ya, the Buddha conducted the Pav\u0101ra\u1e47\u0101 ceremony, marking the conclusion of the retreat. Without delay, he set out for Uruvel\u0101, a place that would soon witness another significant expansion of the Bhikkhu Sa\u1e45gha. During his stay in Uruvel\u0101, which lasted three months, the Blessed One taught and guided the hermit brothers and their one thousand followers, leading them step by step toward the path of awakening.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Expansion of the Monastic Community <span id=\"Endnote7\">[<a href=\"#endnote7\">7</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As the Buddha journeyed from Isipatana to Uruvel\u0101, he encountered a group of thirty young princes, known as the Bhaddavagg\u012bya (the Fortunate Ones). These princes had set out in search of a missing woman but instead found something far greater\u2014the Dhamma. <span id=\"Endnote8\">[<a href=\"#endnote8\">8</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Upon listening to the Buddha\u2019s profound teachings, they experienced a deep realization and attained stream-entry (sot\u0101patti), the first stage of awakening. Moved by their newfound insight, they renounced worldly life and joined the Sangha, further strengthening the growing community of monks.</p>\n<p>At this point, the monastic order had grown significantly: <span id=\"Endnote9\">[<a href=\"#endnote9\">9</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\t\t60 arahants from Isipatana</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\t\t30 newly ordained Bhaddavagg\u012bya monks</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\t\tTotal: 90 monks</p>\n<h4><i>Dhamma Teaching:</i></h4>\n<p>This encounter also gave rise to a well-known Dhamma teaching:</p>\n<p><b>\"Searching for oneself is far better than searching for others.\"</b></p>\n<p>When the Bhaddavagg\u012bya princes explained their original quest, the Buddha posed a thought-provoking question:</p>\n<p><b>\u201cWhat do you think is better\u2014searching for a woman (or others), or searching for yourselves?\u201d</b></p>\n<p>They immediately recognized that the search for self-understanding was far more meaningful than their external pursuits. This teaching highlights a profound truth\u2014instead of looking outward for fulfillment, one should turn inward and cultivate wisdom, for it is through self-examination that one attains true liberation.</p>\n<p><b>The journey to Uruvel\u0101 was more than a physical passage; it was a continuation of the Buddha\u2019s compassionate mission\u2014guiding those who were ready to see the Truth and expanding the Sa\u1e45gha for the benefit of all beings.</b></p>\n<h1>Significant Events at Uruvel\u0101 \u2013 The Taming of the Jatilas</h1>\n<p>After completing his second walking tour, the Blessed One arrived at Uruvel\u0101, <span id=\"Endnote10\">[<a href=\"#endnote10\">10</a>]</span> where he chose to stay at the monastery of Uruvel\u0101 Kassapa, <span id=\"Endnote11\">[<a href=\"#endnote11\">11</a>]</span> a prominent ascetic leader who practiced severe austerities. Kassapa was revered by many and led a community of 300 Jatila (dreadlocked ascetics), who deeply respected his spiritual attainments.</p>\n<p>Despite his reputation, Uruvel\u0101 Kassapa harboured the mistaken belief that he himself was an arahant, and that the Buddha was not. Out of great compassion, the Blessed One sought to free him from his delusion and guide him toward true liberation.</p>\n<h2>The Power of the Buddha\u2019s Compassion \u2013 Subduing the Jatilas</h2>\n<p>To break Kassapa\u2019s pride and open his mind to the truth, the Buddha manifested numerous miracles, each demonstrating his unmatched wisdom and supernormal abilities. These wonders were not performed for mere spectacle but as skilful means (up\u0101ya) to inspire faith and right understanding.<span id=\"Endnote12\">[<a href=\"#endnote12\">12</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Two of the most striking miracles recorded in the Vinaya Pataka were the Taming the Fire Serpent and Log-Splitting Incident:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\tAn encounter with a Naga serpent\u2014a venomous dragon king who lived in the \u2018Fire Hut\u2019 of Uruvel\u0101 Kassapa. Taming of this serpent is described in Section:5.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\t\tLog-Splitting Incident:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\t\tThe Buddha, through his spiritual mastery, prevented 500 logs from being split before he allowed them to be split.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\t\tHe stopped fires from being lit before allowing them to be lit.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\t\tHe halted them from being extinguished before allowing them to be extinguished.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\t\tHe even manifested 500 pans filled with hot coals, leaving the ascetics in awe.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\t\tIn total, the Buddha performed 3,500 such wonders, each revealing his profound power and wisdom. <span id=\"Endnote13\">[<a href=\"#endnote13\">13</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>These miraculous events shattered Kassapa\u2019s false sense of superiority. Realizing the Buddha\u2019s immeasurable spiritual attainment, he humbly submitted and recognized that he was standing before the Fully Enlightened One.</p>\n<h2>The Great Conversion \u2013 The Path to True Liberation</h2>\n<p>With his pride dissolved, Uruvel\u0101 Kassapa and his three-hundred (300) disciples opened their hearts to the Dhamma. Recognizing the futility of their past practices, they renounced their former ways and took refuge in the Buddha.<span id=\"Endnote14\">[<a href=\"#endnote14\">14</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>After three months at the monastery of Uruvel\u0101 Kassapa, the Blessed One finally accomplished the great task of taming Uruvel\u0101 Kassapa, along with his two brothers, Nad\u012b Kassapa and Gay\u0101 Kassapa, and their vast community of ascetic followers. These three brothers, once esteemed leaders of Jatila ascetics, had held firm to their practices, but through the Buddha\u2019s wisdom, patience, and boundless compassion, they gradually realized the futility of their extreme austerities. In the end, the entire community of 1,000 ascetics renounced their former ways and entered the Buddha\u2019s Sangha, marking one of the most significant mass ordinations in history.<span id=\"Endnote15\">[<a href=\"#endnote15\">15</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This moment was not just a personal transformation for Kassapa\u2014it marked the conversion of an entire community of ascetics, who had once clung to extreme austerities but now walked the path of the Middle Way under the guidance of the Buddha. The taming of the Jatilas at Uruvel\u0101 stands as a powerful testament to the Buddha\u2019s skilful means, boundless compassion, and unwavering dedication to leading beings from ignorance to wisdom.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page13_2/image4.png\" />\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>Uruvela Kassapa and his Pupils becoming Disciples of the Buddha </b><span id=\"Endnote16\">[<a href=\"#endnote16\">16</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This remarkable event highlights one of the nine noble qualities of the Buddha:</p>\n<p>Anuttaro purisa-damma-s\u0101rathi \u2013 \"<b>The unsurpassed trainer of those who can be trained.</b>\"</p>\n<p>As an extraordinary spiritual guide, the Buddha knew precisely how to break through delusions and lead beings to liberation, using skilful means (up\u0101ya) and wisdom (pa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101) to transform even the most stubborn seekers. <span id=\"Endnote17\">[<a href=\"#endnote17\">17</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The scriptures affirm that the Blessed One remained in Uruvel\u0101 for three months, dedicating his time to taming and guiding Kassapa and his followers, ensuring their complete understanding of the Dhamma before setting out on his next journey.<span id=\"Endnote18\">[<a href=\"#endnote18\">18</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>The Third Walking and Teaching Tour \u2013 From Uruvel\u0101 to R\u0101jagaha via Gay\u0101s\u012bsa </h1>\n<p>Following the conversion of the Kassapa brothers and their disciples, the Blessed One set out once again, leading his newly ordained 1,000 monks from Uruvel\u0101 to Gay\u0101s\u012bsa and then to R\u0101jagaha.</p>\n<p>This marks the <b>Third Teaching Tour</b> of the Buddha, as recorded in the Vinaya Pi\u1e6daka:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cAfter staying at Uruvel\u0101 for as long as he wished, the Buddha went to Gay\u0101s\u012bsa together with that great Sa\u1e45gha of one thousand monks, all of them previously dreadlocked ascetics, and they stayed there\u2026\u201d </i><span id=\"Endnote19\">[<a href=\"#endnote19\">19</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This journey signified not only the expansion of the Sangha but also the Buddha\u2019s compassionate resolve to bring the Dhamma to those ready to receive it, guiding them step by step toward the highest peace\u2014Nibb\u0101na.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page13_2/image5.png\" />\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>The Buddha walking with large number of Sangha from Uruvel\u0101 to Gay\u0101s\u012bsa </b><span id=\"Endnote20\">[<a href=\"#endnote20\">20</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page13_2/image6.png\" />\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>Third Walking Tour of the Buddha </b><span id=\"Endnote21\">[<a href=\"#endnote21\">21</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>The route</b>: Uruvel\u0101 to Gayasisa and then to Rajagaha.

He declared: <span id=\"Endnote25\">[<a href=\"#endnote25\">25</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>\u201cBhikkhus, everything is burning.\u201d</b></p>\n<p><b>What is burning?</b></p>\n<p>Everything that we experience\u2014the six sense faculties (eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind), the six external objects (forms, sounds, smells, tastes, touches, and thoughts), and the consciousness arising from their contact\u2014is on fire.</p>\n<p><b>Burning with what?</b></p>\n<p>\ud83d\udd25 The <b>fire of craving (r\u0101ga)</b></p>\n<p>\ud83d\udd25 The <b>fire of aversion (dosa)</b></p>\n<p>\ud83d\udd25 The <b>fire of delusion (moha)</b></p>\n<p>\ud83d\udd25 The <b>fires of birth, aging, and death</b></p>\n<p>\ud83d\udd25 The <b>fires of sorrow, lamentation, pain, despair, and suffering</b></p>\n<p>This is not just a metaphor\u2014it is a direct truth about the impermanent, unsatisfactory, and selfless nature of all phenomena. The worldly mind clings to these fleeting experiences, but in reality, they are consumed by flames, bringing suffering rather than true happiness.</p>\n<h3>The Path to Liberation</h3>\n<p>When one truly sees this burning nature of existence, a deep sense of disenchantment (nibbid\u0101) arises. No longer deceived by the illusion of pleasure in worldly attachments, the mind naturally let\u2019s go.</p>\n<p>\u27a1 With disenchantment comes dispassion (vir\u0101ga).</p>\n<p>\u27a1 With dispassion, the mind is liberated (vimutti).</p>\n<p>\u27a1 With liberation, true wisdom arises:<b> </b></p>\n<p><i>\"Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being.\"</i><span id=\"Endnote26\">[<a href=\"#endnote26\">26</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This teaching strikes at the root of suffering, offering a clear and direct path to Nibb\u0101na\u2014the unshakable peace beyond the fires of craving and attachment.</p>\n<h3>A Thousand Monks Attain Arahantship</h3>\n<p>As the Buddha spoke, the words of truth penetrated deeply into the hearts of the 1,000 monks. With perfect clarity, they realized the burning nature of all conditioned things and, at that very moment, their minds were completely liberated from all fetters.</p>\n<p><b>They attained arahantship\u2014full awakening!</b></p>\n<p>This event at Gay\u0101s\u012bsa was not only a turning point for these monks but also a testament to the power of the Buddha\u2019s wisdom. The Fire Sermon remains one of the most striking and transformative discourses, guiding countless beings toward the cooling peace of Nibb\u0101na, where all fires of suffering are extinguished forever.</p>\n<h2>Expansion of the Bhikkhu community</h2>\n<p>Earlier we saw that Buddha has about ninety (90) disciples\u2014five group of monks + Yasa and his friends 60 + 30 of Bhaddavaggiya princes. With the addition of 1000 newly ordained bhikkhus he had about 1090 disciples.

During this time, he accomplished several significant milestones. He established the first Bhikkhu Sangha, training and dispatching monks to teach the Dhamma for the benefit of all. He also gained a devoted group of lay followers who provided support for the flourishing of his dispensation.</p>\n<h1>The Buddha Arrives at R\u0101jagaha with a Large Group of Monks</h1>\n<p>At the beginning of this section, we see the Buddha continuing his teachings while gathering both disciples and lay supporters. This period is generally considered to have begun when the Buddha, accompanied by a large assembly of monks, arrived in R\u0101jagaha, the capital of Magadha, from Gaya. This marked the completion of his third walking tour.</p>\n<p>It is believed that when the Blessed One entered R\u0101jagaha for the second time in his life, he was in the prime of his youth\u2014just thirty-five years old. <span id=\"Endnote1\">[<a href=\"#endnote1\">1</a>]</span>  He remained in and around R\u0101jagaha for nearly three years, continuing to share the Dhamma with those who sought liberation.</p>\n<p>The <i>Vinaya Pitaka</i> provides the following account of the Buddha\u2019s arrival in R\u0101jagaha:</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>After staying at Gay\u0101s\u012bsa for as long as he liked, the Buddha set out wandering toward R\u0101jagaha with that large sangha of one thousand monks, all of them previously dreadlocked ascetics.

During the time of the Buddha, its northern border was the Ganges River, while the Vindhya Mountain range marked its southern boundary. The Sona River formed its western limit, and to the east lay the state of A\u1e45ga. R\u0101jagaha, the capital of Magadha, was one of the most powerful cities among the sixteen great states of that era.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page14_1/image1.jpeg\" />\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>Map showing the ancient Magadha Kingdom</b> <b>during the time of the Buddha </b><span id=\"Endnote6\">[<a href=\"#endnote6\">6</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page14_1/image2.png\" />\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>Modern day map of Bihar state (Magadha) of India </b><span id=\"Endnote7\">[<a href=\"#endnote7\">7</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Places where the Buddha stayed during the three vassa season</h3>\n<p>According to scriptures and legend, during the three years the Blessed One resided in R\u0101jagaha, he spent time at the Bamboo Grove Monastery as well as Vulture\u2019s Peak (also known as the Eagle Peak or Gijjhak\u016b\u1e6da) in the hilly outskirts of the city. He may have also stayed at a few other locations during this period.</p>\n<p>The <i>A\u1e45guttara Nik\u0101ya</i> (AN 7:61) records that on one occasion, while dwelling among the Bhaggas at Su\u1e43sum\u0101ragira in the Deer Park at Bhesakal\u0101 Grove, the Buddha perceived with his divine eye that Venerable Mah\u0101 Moggall\u0101na was struggling with his meditation at Kallav\u0101lamuttag\u0101ma, a village in Magadha. In response, the Blessed One appeared there to assist him. This account indicates that before the second rainy season, during his stay in R\u0101jagaha, the Buddha visited Su\u1e43sum\u0101ragira\u2014identified with present-day Chunar, approximately 318 km from R\u0101jagaha (see map).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page14_1/image3.png\" />\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>Map showing location of Rajgir (ancient R\u0101jagaha) and Chunar (ancient Su\u1e43sum\u0101ragira</b>) <span id=\"Endnote8\">[<a href=\"#endnote8\">8</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In the Bodhir\u0101jakum\u0101ra Sutta (MN: 85), there is a statement confirming that on one occasion, the Buddha stayed among the Bhaggas at Su\u1e41sum\u0101ragira in the Bhesaka\u1e37\u0101 Grove, the Deer Park. Prince Bodhi recounted:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cThen my nurse, carrying me on her hip, went to the Blessed One at Bhesaka\u1e37\u0101 Grove.

A question arose in their minds:<span id=\"Endnote16\">[<a href=\"#endnote16\">16</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\u201cIs the Great Ascetic practicing the spiritual life under Uruvel\u0101 Kassapa, or is Uruvel\u0101 Kassapa practicing under the Great Ascetic?\u201d</i></p>\n<p>Sensing their doubts with his divine insight, the Buddha skilfully guided a dialogue with Bhikkhu Uruvel\u0101 Kassapa, illuminating the truth. With profound wisdom and compassion, he dispelled their confusion, leading them to a clear realization\u2014the Blessed One was the true Teacher, and the monks were his disciples.</p>\n<p>The scriptures describe the powerful moment that followed. At the conclusion of the dialogue, Uruvel\u0101 Kassapa, who had once been revered as a great spiritual leader, rose from his seat, humbly bowed before the Blessed One, and declared:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cSir, you are my teacher; I am your disciple. You are my teacher; I am your disciple.\u201d</i><span id=\"Endnote17\">[<a href=\"#endnote17\">17</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>With this, a great transformation took place. Faith was firmly established in the hearts of King Bimbis\u0101ra and the large gathering of Brahmins. The light of the Dhamma had begun to shine in Magadha, dispelling ignorance and opening the path to liberation for many.</p>\n<h2>Profound Dhamma Reflections in Magadha</h2>\n<p>According to the <i>Vinaya Pi\u1e6daka</i>, on this momentous occasion, the Buddha imparted profound Dhamma teachings to the people of Magadha, illuminating the path beyond suffering and sa\u1e41s\u0101ra. <span id=\"Endnote18\">[<a href=\"#endnote18\">18</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>1) True Liberation Lies Beyond Rituals</h3>\n<p>At that time, the prevailing belief in Magadha was that fire sacrifices brought great merit and favourable outcomes in life. Many considered ritualistic offerings to be the highest form of spiritual practice. However, the Buddha, out of compassion, dispelled this misconception, revealing that no external rituals could lead to true peace and liberation. Only through earnest practice of the Dhamma could one transcend the cycle of birth and death.</p>\n<p>To illustrate this, the Buddha instructed Bhikkhu Uruvel\u0101 Kassapa to share why he had abandoned the practice of fire sacrifices. Kassapa, once a highly esteemed ascetic devoted to ritual offerings, spoke these insightful words:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cAs a reward for the sacrifice, they promise sense pleasures\u2014</i></p>\n<p><i>Sights, sounds, and tastes, and women, too.</i></p>\n<p><i>But knowing the stain of ownership,</i></p>\n<p><i>I found no delight in worship and sacrifice.\u201d </i><span id=\"Endnote19\">[<a href=\"#endnote19\">19</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>With this reflection, those gathered realized the futility of worldly offerings and the impermanence of sensual pleasures. True liberation, they understood, could only be attained through wisdom and direct realization of the Dhamma.</p>\n<h3>2) The Revelation of the Four Noble Truths</h3>\n<p>Seeing that the hearts of King Bimbis\u0101ra and the vast assembly were receptive, the Buddha delivered a gradual discourse (<i>anupubbikath\u0101</i>), guiding them from the understanding of generosity (<i>d\u0101na</i>), morality (<i>s\u012bla</i>), and the benefits of renunciation, toward the essence of the Dhamma. When their minds became clear, free from hindrances, and filled with joy and confidence, the Buddha expounded the teaching unique to all Buddhas\u2014the Four Noble Truths:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\t\tThe truth of suffering (<i>dukkha</i>)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\t\tThe cause of suffering (<i>samudaya</i>)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\t\tThe cessation of suffering (<i>nirodha</i>)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\t\tThe path leading to the cessation of suffering (<i>magga</i>)</p>\n<p>The <i>Vinaya Pi\u1e6daka</i> describes the extraordinary impact of this teaching:<span id=\"Endnote20\">[<a href=\"#endnote20\">20</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\u201cWhen the Buddha knew that their minds were ready, supple, without hindrances, joyful, and confident, he revealed the teaching unique to the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its end, and the path. And just as a clean and stainless cloth absorbs dye properly, so too, while they were sitting right there, one hundred and ten thousand of those Brahmin householders, led by Bimbis\u0101ra, experienced the stainless vision of the Truth: \u2018Anything that has a beginning has an end.\u2019\u201d</i></p>\n<p>At that very moment, these individuals attained <i>sot\u0101patti</i> (stream-entry), freeing themselves from doubt and wrong views, ensuring that they would never again be reborn in lower realms. The remaining ten thousand, though not yet reaching this realization, declared themselves lay followers, committing their lives to the path of the Dhamma.</p>\n<h3>A Teaching of Great Significance</h3>\n<p>The <i>Mah\u0101vastu</i>, an ancient Buddhist text, <span id=\"Endnote21\">[<a href=\"#endnote21\">21</a>]</span> states that this momentous discourse was the fourth formal Dhamma teaching of the Buddha, following the <i>\u0100dittapariy\u0101ya Sutta</i> (The Fire Sermon). However, no direct scriptural references have been found to confirm this claim.</p>\n<p>Regardless, this occasion stands as a testament to the Buddha\u2019s boundless compassion and wisdom. In a land where rituals and sacrifices had long been revered, he skilfully led countless beings toward true refuge\u2014not in external rites, but in the unshakable realization of the Noble Truths. Through this profound teaching, the light of the Dhamma began to shine ever brighter in Magadha, touching the hearts of many and setting them firmly on the path to liberation<b>.</b></p>\n<h2>Sakka, the Lord of Devas, Praises the Buddha</h2>\n<p>Having attained stream-entry, King Bimbis\u0101ra was filled with devotion and gratitude. Wishing to express his reverence, he invited the Buddha and his disciples for a meal at his palace. As the Blessed One, accompanied by the great Sa\u1e45gha, made his way from the outskirts of the city into R\u0101jagaha, an extraordinary event unfolded. <span id=\"Endnote22\">[<a href=\"#endnote22\">22</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page14_1/image7.jpeg\" />\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>Sakka the Lorad of the Devas descended from his celestial abode, disguised as a brahmin youth walking ahead of the Buddha and reciting beautiful verses praising the Blessed One.</b><span id=\"Endnote23\">[<a href=\"#endnote23\">23</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Sakka, the Lord of the Devas, <span id=\"Endnote24\">[<a href=\"#endnote24\">24</a>]</span> overcome with boundless joy, descended from his celestial abode. Disguised as a young Brahmin, he walked ahead of the Buddha, extolling his supreme virtues in verses that resonated through the streets of R\u0101jagaha:</p>\n<p><b><i>\u201cThe Peaceful One with the peaceful ones,</i></b><b></p>\n<p></b><b><i>Previously dreadlocked;</i></b><b></p>\n<p></b><b><i>The Liberated One with the liberated ones:</i></b><b></p>\n<p></b><b><i>Golden in colour,</i></b><b></p>\n<p></b><b><i>The Buddha entered R\u0101jagaha.\u201d</i></b><span id=\"Endnote25\">[<a href=\"#endnote25\">25</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Hearing these profound words, the people of Magadha were struck with wonder. Who was this radiant young Brahmin who spoke with such reverence and insight? Moved by curiosity, they asked about his identity.</p>\n<p>Revealing himself, Sakka spoke once more, his voice imbued with deep devotion:</p>\n<p><b><i>\u201cUnwavering and tamed in all respects,</i></b><b></p>\n<p></b><b><i>Purified, perfected, and without equal;</i></b><b></p>\n<p></b><b><i>The one in the world who is truly happy\u2014</i></b><b></p>\n<p></b><b><i>I am his servant.\u201d</i></b></p>\n<p>At that moment, the people of Magadha witnessed something extraordinary: even the ruler of the celestial realms humbled himself before the Awakened One. The sight of the Deva King offering his highest praise to the Buddha stirred great faith in the hearts of many. It became evident to them that the Blessed One was not merely a teacher of men but a guide revered by both humans and devas alike\u2014a beacon of wisdom and compassion, illuminating the path to liberation for all beings.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page14_1/image8.jpeg\" />\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>King Bimbisara offering Veluvana the first monastery to the Buddha </b><span id=\"Endnote26\">[<a href=\"#endnote26\">26</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>The First Monastery in R\u0101jagaha: A Royal Offering</h1>\n<p>After offering a grand meal to the Buddha and his disciples, King Bimbis\u0101ra reflected deeply on how he could best support the Buddha\u2019s dispensation. Understanding the need for a peaceful dwelling place where the Blessed One and his Sa\u1e45gha could reside and teach undisturbed, he searched for a suitable location not far from his palace. His eyes fell upon his royal park, <i>Ve\u1e37uvana</i>\u2014the Bamboo Grove\u2014a serene retreat, abundant with shade, tranquillity, and natural beauty.<b> </b><span id=\"Endnote27\">[<a href=\"#endnote27\">27</a>]</span><b> </b></p>\n<p>Determined to make this noble offering, the king performed a traditional water ceremony, a sacred act of dedication.

The tradition serves as a profound reminder of the enduring generosity of the laity in upholding and protecting the Buddha\u2019s teachings.</p>\n<h3>A Turning Point in the Vinaya</h3>\n<p>During this period, significant developments in the monastic discipline (<i>Vinaya</i>) took place. At the request of King Bimbis\u0101ra, the Buddha established an essential practice for the Sa\u1e45gha\u2014the observance of <i>Uposatha</i> (the fortnightly assembly on the 8th, 14th, and 15th lunar days). On these days, the monks would gather to recite the <i>P\u0101timokkha</i> (the monastic code of discipline) and offer Dhamma teachings to the lay community. This marked the beginning of a structured system of monastic observance, ensuring the purity and unity of the Sa\u1e45gha. <span id=\"Endnote30\">[<a href=\"#endnote30\">30</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>A Legacy of Generosity and Wisdom</h3>\n<p>King Bimbis\u0101ra\u2019s offering of Ve\u1e37uvana was more than a gift of land\u2014it was a timeless act of devotion that provided a refuge for the Dhamma to flourish. His deep faith and wisdom in supporting the Buddha\u2019s mission set a precedent for future generations, demonstrating how a righteous leader could contribute to the well-being of countless beings.</p>\n<p>From this sacred ground, the Buddha would continue to teach, transforming lives with the wisdom of the Dhamma. Ve\u1e37uvana became not only the first monastery but also a symbol of the harmonious relationship between the Sa\u1e45gha and the laity\u2014a relationship built upon generosity, virtue, and the shared aspiration for liberation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page14_1/image9.png\" />\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>Beautiful Veluvanaya- Bamboo Grove\u2014the first monastery offered to the Buddha and the Sangha </b><span id=\"Endnote31\">[<a href=\"#endnote31\">31</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Insights from Other Sources on the Offering of Veluvana</h3>\n<p>As mentioned in the introduction to this series (Section 13), we have drawn from additional sources to provide a fuller account of significant events that took place during this period. The <i>Vinaya Pi\u1e6daka</i> records: <span id=\"Endnote32\">[<a href=\"#endnote32\">32</a>]</span><i> </i></p>\n<p><i>\u201cThe Buddha accepted the park.

To bridge this gap, we refer to another source, which offers a profound teaching on the merit of offering monasteries to the Sa\u1e45gha:</p>\n<h3>The Merit of Offering Monasteries</h3>\n<p>On the occasion of King Bimbis\u0101ra\u2019s offering of the Bamboo Grove (<i>Veluvana</i>) to the Buddha\u2019s dispensation, the Blessed One expounded:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cGreat King! One who builds and generously offers a monastery as a dwelling place for the community of bhikkhus bestows upon them the boon of longevity, good health, happiness, strength, and admirable wisdom.\u201d </i><span id=\"Endnote33\">[<a href=\"#endnote33\">33</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>A monastery provides shelter from dangers such as extreme heat and cold, preserving the well-being of its residents. Thus, the donor of such a refuge is praised by the wise as one who offers the gift of life itself.</i></p>\n<p><i>Therefore, one who makes such an offering can be assured\u2014without the slightest doubt\u2014of happiness in both mind and body, not only in this life but also in future existences.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>Having thus blessed King Bimbis\u0101ra with these words, the Buddha arose from his seat. Accompanied by a retinue of one thousand bhikkhus, he proceeded to Veluvana, where he took up residence.</p>\n<h3>Additional Insights and Legends</h3>\n<p><b>A Sacred Moment in History</b> \u2013</p>\n<p>According to legend: <span id=\"Endnote34\">[<a href=\"#endnote34\">34</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\t\tas King Bimbis\u0101ra poured water from a golden vessel over the Buddha\u2019s hand\u2014following the customary ritual of dedication\u2014the earth itself trembled.  It is said that nature rejoiced, for this marked the firm establishment of the Blessed One\u2019s dispensation in the world.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\t\t<b>The First Vinaya Rule on Monastery Donations</b> \u2013 It was on this occasion that the Buddha established the first <i>Vinaya</i> rule permitting the Sa\u1e45gha to accept monasteries as dwellings. <span id=\"Endnote35\">[<a href=\"#endnote35\">35</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\t\t<b>Why Veluvana is Called Kalandakaniv\u0101pa</b> \u2013 The monastery became known as <i>Kalandakaniv\u0101pa</i> (\u201cFeeding Place of Squirrels\u201d) because it was home to many squirrels, who were often seen in the area.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\t\t<b>Who Was Present at Veluvana?</b> \u2013 The scriptures recount that when the Buddha first resided in Veluvana, he was accompanied by Venerable Uruvela Kassapa and his group of one thousand monks. At this time, Venerable S\u0101riputta and Venerable Moggall\u0101na had not yet joined the Sa\u1e45gha. However, Venerable Assaji, one of the first five disciples, was present in R\u0101jagaha. It is likely that the group of five bhikkhus who had first heard the Dhamma at Isipatana later travelled to R\u0101jagaha as part of the early missionary efforts to spread the Buddha\u2019s teachings.</p>\n<p>This momentous event not only secured a permanent dwelling for the Buddha and his followers but also set a precedent for the great tradition of monastery offerings, a practice that continues to bring immeasurable merit to this day.</p>\n<h2>The Tiroku\u1e6d\u1e6da Sutta: The Importance of Sharing Merit with Departed Relatives</h2>\n<p>The following account, drawn from another source, provides insight into the circumstances that led the Blessed One to deliver the <i>Tiroku\u1e6d\u1e6da Sutta</i> <span id=\"Endnote36\">[<a href=\"#endnote36\">36</a>]</span>and highlights the significance of transferring merit to departed relatives. <span id=\"Endnote37\">[<a href=\"#endnote37\">37</a>]</span></p>\n<h3>The King\u2019s Dream and the Hungry Ghosts</h3>\n<p>After King Bimbis\u0101ra dedicated Veluvana Monastery to the Buddha and the Sa\u1e45gha, he accumulated immense merit. Unknown to him, however, his departed relatives\u2014now reborn as <i>Petas</i> (hungry ghosts) <span id=\"Endnote38\">[<a href=\"#endnote38\">38</a>]</span>\u2014had gathered in the unseen realm, hoping to receive a share of his merit. Having wandered in <i>sa\u1e43s\u0101ra</i> for a long time, they remained in a state of suffering, longing for their living relative to dedicate merit on their behalf.</p>\n<p>Since they had not received any offerings, they appeared in the King\u2019s dream that night, their presence terrifying him. Deeply disturbed, the King sought the guidance of the Blessed One, recounting his fearful vision. With his divine eye, the Buddha perceived the suffering of these beings and explained that their long existence in the ghostly realm was due to the absence of transferred merit from their relatives. He then advised the King to dedicate merit on their behalf.</p>\n<h3>The King\u2019s Offering and the Rejoicing of the Petas</h3>\n<p>Following the Buddha\u2019s instruction, King Bimbis\u0101ra arranged a great <i>d\u0101na</i>, offering food and requisites to the Buddha and the Sa\u1e45gha. As he poured water over the Buddha\u2019s hands\u2014a symbolic act of dedication\u2014he solemnly declared:</p>\n<p>\"Ida\u1e43 me \u00f1\u0101tina\u1e43 hotu\"</p>\n<p><i>\"May this merit be for the well-being of my departed relatives.\"</i></p>\n<p>The moment the King shared his merits, the Petas rejoiced. Moved by compassion for the King and his ancestors, the Blessed One made an aspiration, allowing the King to witness his former relatives attaining better existences and enjoying their new lives as a result of the dedicated merit.</p>\n<p>The Buddha then delivered the <i>Tiroku\u1e6d\u1e6da Sutta</i>, emphasizing the importance of sharing merits with departed relatives:</p>\n<p>\"Outside the walls they stand and wait,</p>\n<p>at the junctions and the crossroads.</p>\n<p>Returning to their former homes,</p>\n<p>they wait beside the doorposts.</p>\n<p>But when lavish food and drink of many kinds are set out,</p>\n<p>no one remembers them at all,</p>\n<p>because of those beings\u2019 deeds.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s why those who have compassion</p>\n<p>give to their relatives\u2019 food and drink at the right time\u2014</p>\n<p>clean, delicious, and suitable.</p>\n<p>Just as rivers replenish the ocean,</p>\n<p>so too does what is given here aid the departed ones.</p>\n<p>Neither tears, nor grief, nor lamentations</p>\n<p>are of any use to the departed.</p>\n<p>But when an offering is made in the Sa\u1e45gha\u2019s name,</p>\n<p>it brings lasting benefit and aids them immediately.</p>\n<p>This is the duty of the living:</p>\n<p>to honour departed relatives,</p>\n<p>to support the mendicants,</p>\n<p>and in doing so, to generate great merit.\" <span id=\"Endnote39\">[<a href=\"#endnote39\">39</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page14_1/image10.png\" />\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>The Hungry Ghosts - Outside the walls they stand and wait </b><span id=\"Endnote40\">[<a href=\"#endnote40\">40</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>The Lasting Impact of the Teaching</h3>\n<p>This is the first recorded occasion in the scriptures where the Buddha explicitly highlighted the significance of dedicating merit to departed relatives. Such acts not only benefit those in the <i>peta</i> realm but also bring blessings to the donors themselves. In later discourses, the Buddha elaborated further on this practice. <span id=\"Endnote41\">[<a href=\"#endnote41\">41</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Another source states that at the conclusion of the <i>Tiroku\u1e6d\u1e6da Sutta</i>, 84,000 sentient beings became keenly aware of the grave dangers of rebirth in the <i>peta</i> realm. <span id=\"Endnote42\">[<a href=\"#endnote42\">42</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Buddha\u2019s vivid description of their suffering stirred within them a sense of spiritual urgency (<i>sa\u1e43vega</i>), prompting them to diligently practice the Dhamma. As a result, many attained insights into the Noble Truths and achieved liberation.</p>\n<p>Thus, the <i>Tiroku\u1e6d\u1e6da Sutta</i> stands as a timeless reminder of the power of generosity, the responsibility of the living towards their departed loved ones, and the immense merit generated by such compassionate acts.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page14_1/image11.png\" />\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>The Buddha sitting in the beautiful forest grove in Jetavana Monastery </b><span id=\"Endnote43\">[<a href=\"#endnote43\">43</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>Significant Events at Veluvana Monastery in R\u0101jagaha</h1>\n<p>During this period, the Blessed One resided at Veluvana Monastery in R\u0101jagaha, surrounded by a large community of bhikkhus, supported by King Bimbis\u0101ra and devoted lay followers of the Magadha kingdom. By the time the two chief disciples\u2014S\u0101riputta and Moggall\u0101na\u2014joined the Sa\u1e45gha, Veluvana had already become a thriving centre of Dhamma activities, where new monks were trained and teachings were given to both the monastic and lay communities.</p>\n<p>One source suggests that at this point, the Buddha had been in R\u0101jagaha for approximately half a month. <span id=\"Endnote44\">[<a href=\"#endnote44\">44</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page14_1/image12.png\" />\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>Venerable Assaji uttering his famous verse of the teaching of his Gret Teacher </b><span id=\"Endnote45\">[<a href=\"#endnote45\">45</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>The Arrival of S\u0101riputta and Moggall\u0101na\u2014The Two Chief Disciples</h2>\n<p>Among the many significant events that took place at Veluvana, one of the most momentous was the arrival of the two noble ones, S\u0101riputta and Moggall\u0101na\u2014formerly known as the wanderers Upatissa and Kolitha\u2014who would go on to become the Blessed One\u2019s <i>right-hand and left-hand</i> disciples. <span id=\"Endnote46\">[<a href=\"#endnote46\">46</a>]</span></p>\n<p>At the time, these two seekers were disciples of the wandering ascetic Sa\u00f1jaya Bela\u1e6d\u1e6dhiputta, <span id=\"Endnote47\">[<a href=\"#endnote47\">47</a>]</span>  living near R\u0101jagaha.

While ordinary beings become elated by praise and distressed by criticism, the Buddha and the noble ones remained unmoved by either.</p>\n<p>The <i>Vinaya Pi\u1e6daka</i> records incidents during the Buddha\u2019s stay in R\u0101jagaha that illustrate this truth.</p>\n<h3>Praise from the King of Devas</h3>\n<p>Earlier, we saw how Sakka, the King of Devas, came to R\u0101jagaha to express his profound reverence for the Buddha. Recognizing the Blessed One\u2019s supreme wisdom and boundless compassion, Sakka praised him as the teacher of both gods and humans.</p>\n<h3>Criticism from the People of Magadha</h3>\n<p>At the same time, as the Buddha compassionately preached the Dhamma in R\u0101jagaha, many young men of Magadha\u2014some from well-known families\u2014renounced the household life and became monastics. Witnessing this, certain people in the city began to grumble, blaming the Buddha for causing disruption in their society: <span id=\"Endnote61\">[<a href=\"#endnote61\">61</a>]</span></p>\n<p><b>\u201c</b><i>The ascetic Gotama is making us childless!

Instead of reacting with resentment, he instructed them to recite the following verse if they encountered such complaints:</p>\n<p><b>\u201cIndeed, the Great Heroes, the Buddhas,</b></p>\n<p><b>Lead by means of a good teaching.</b></p>\n<p><b>When you understand this, what indignation can there be</b></p>\n<p><b>Toward those who lead legitimately?\u201d </b><span id=\"Endnote62\">[<a href=\"#endnote62\">62</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Upon hearing this, the people of Magadha gradually understood that the Sakyan monastics had renounced the world in a noble and rightful manner. Their complaints subsided, and they came to respect the path of renunciation.</p>\n<h3>The Buddha\u2019s Unshakable Equanimity</h3>\n<p>Through this episode, the Blessed One demonstrated that praise and blame are merely part of the ever-changing nature of the world. While some praised his wisdom and compassion, others criticized him out of attachment and misunderstanding. Yet, the Buddha remained unshaken, guiding beings with patience and wisdom.</p>\n<p>Thus, the words of the Great Sage remind us:</p>\n<p><b>\u201cJust as a solid rock remains unmoved by the wind,</b></p>\n<p><b>so too, the wise remain unshaken by praise or blame.\u201d</b><span id=\"Endnote63\">[<a href=\"#endnote63\">63</a>]</span><b> </b></p>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2>J\u012bvaka Kom\u0101rabhacca \u2013 The Esteemed Physician </h2>\n<p>According to the <i>Vinaya Pi\u1e6daka</i>, King Bimbis\u0101ra, recognizing the exceptional skills of J\u012bvaka Kom\u0101rabhacca, <span id=\"Endnote64\">[<a href=\"#endnote64\">64</a>]</span><b> </b>appointed him as the royal physician and entrusted him with the care of the Buddha and the Sangha.

Some of the key insights from these discourses are as follows:</p>\n<h2>Nothing in the World is Worth Clinging To</h2>\n<p>One of the most transformative teachings was given to Venerable Mah\u0101 Moggall\u0101na, guiding him toward full liberation. The Blessed One revealed that true freedom from suffering comes from relinquishing attachment to all worldly things:</p>\n<p>\u201cHere, Moggall\u0101na, a bhikkhu has heard: \u2018Nothing is worth holding to.\u2019</p>\n<p>When a bhikkhu has heard: \u2018Nothing is worth holding to,\u2019 he directly knows all things.</p>\n<p>Having directly known all things, he fully understands all things.</p>\n<p>Having fully understood all things, whatever feeling he feels\u2014pleasant, painful, or neutral\u2014</p>\n<p>he contemplates its impermanence, its fading away, its cessation, and its relinquishment.</p>\n<p>As he dwells contemplating thus, he does not cling to anything in the world.</p>\n<p>Not clinging, he is not agitated. Being unagitated, he personally attains Nibb\u0101na.</p>\n<p>He understands: \u2018Destroyed is birth; the spiritual life has been lived; what had to be done has been done; there is no more coming back to any state of being.\u2019\u201d <i> </i><span id=\"Endnote68\">[<a href=\"#endnote68\">68</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This teaching encapsulates the essence of the path to liberation\u2014letting go of attachment to everything impermanent.</p>\n<h2>Overcoming Drowsiness in Meditation</h2>\n<p>Venerable Moggall\u0101na, during his meditation practice, struggled with drowsiness. The Buddha compassionately instructed him on seven practical methods to overcome it:  <span id=\"Endnote69\">[<a href=\"#endnote69\">69</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1)\tChange the focus \u2013 Shift attention from the meditation object if it induces drowsiness.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2)\tReflect on the Dhamma \u2013 Contemplate the teachings that have been learned.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>3)\tRecite aloud \u2013 If drowsiness persists, reciting a sutta helps refocus the mind.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>4)\tPhysical stimulation \u2013 Pulling the ears and rubbing the limbs can awaken the senses.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>5)\tRefresh the senses \u2013 Washing the face, surveying the surroundings, and gazing at the sky dispels dullness.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>6)\tPerception of Light \u2013 Meditate on brightness, cultivating a luminous mind.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>7)\tWalking Meditation \u2013 Walk back and forth with mindfulness, keeping awareness of both front and back.</p>\n<p>If drowsiness remains despite these efforts, the Buddha advised lying down mindfully with the determination to rise promptly, without indulging in the pleasure of sleep.</p>\n<h2>The Path to Jh\u0101nas and Immaterial States</h2>\n<p>In the <i>Moggall\u0101na Sa\u1e41yutta</i> (SN 40), nine discourses describe the Buddha\u2019s guidance to Venerable Moggall\u0101na in developing deep sam\u0101dh<i>i</i> <span id=\"Endnote70\">[<a href=\"#endnote70\">70</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\t<b>Regarding the Four Jh\u0101nas</b> \u2013 The Buddha repeatedly instructed:</p>\n<p>\u201cMoggall\u0101na, do not be negligent regarding the first jh\u0101na\u2026 the second jh\u0101na\u2026 the third jh\u0101na\u2026 the fourth jh\u0101na.</p>\n<p>Steady your mind, unify your mind, concentrate your mind in these meditative absorptions.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\tRegarding the <b>Four Immaterial Attainments</b> \u2013 The Buddha further advised:</p>\n<p>\u201cMoggall\u0101na, do not neglect the base of the infinity of space, the base of the infinity of consciousness, the base of nothingness, and the base of neither-perception-nor-nonperception.</p>\n<p>Steady your mind, unify your mind, concentrate your mind in these attainments.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\tRegarding <b>the Sign-less </b><i>sam\u0101dhi</i>  (<i>Animitta Ceto-sam\u0101dhi</i>) \u2013 The Buddha emphasized:</p>\n<p>\u201cMoggall\u0101na, do not be negligent regarding the sign-less concentration of mind.</p>\n<p>Steady your mind, unify your mind, concentrate your mind in this profound state.\u201d</p>\n<p>Through these instructions, the Blessed One revealed the step-by-step progression towards the highest liberation.</p>\n<h2>The Impermanence of the Body and Feelings</h2>\n<p>Another profound discourse was delivered to the Brahmin D\u012bghanakha, who was Venerable S\u0101riputta\u2019s nephew. This discourse, given at the Boar\u2019s Cave on Vulture Peak, resulted in D\u012bghanakha attaining stream-entry and Venerable S\u0101riputta realizing arahantship.<i> </i><span id=\"Endnote71\">[<a href=\"#endnote71\">71</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Buddha taught:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cThe body should be regarded as impermanent, as suffering, as a disease, as a tumour, as a dart, as a calamity, as an affliction, as alien, as disintegrating, as void, as not-self.</p>\n<p>When one regards the body thus, one abandons desire for the body</i>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the Buddha explained the nature of feelings:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cThere are three kinds of feeling: pleasant, painful, and neither-painful-nor-pleasant.</p>\n<p>All feelings are impermanent, conditioned, dependently arisen, and subject to cessation.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>Upon truly understanding this, a well-instructed disciple becomes disenchanted with feelings and abandons attachment. As a result, the mind becomes liberated, and with that liberation comes the realization:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cBirth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being.\u201d</i></p>\n<h2>The Path of the Noble Ones</h2>\n<p>Through these teachings, the Blessed One illuminated the path to liberation\u2014one that transcends worldly attachments, overcomes hindrances, and cultivates profound wisdom. The stories of J\u012bvaka Kom\u0101rabhacca, Venerable Moggall\u0101na, and Venerable S\u0101riputta serve as shining examples of unwavering faith, perseverance, and ultimate realization.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The words of the Buddha remain timeless</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>\u201c</b>Nothing is worth holding to.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cSteady your mind in the jh\u0101nas, unify your mind, concentrate your mind.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cThe wise, seeing impermanence, abandon clinging and attain Nibb\u0101na.\u201d</p>\n<p>May all beings walk this noble path toward true liberation!</p>\n<h1>More Illustrious Disciples Joining the Sangha from Magadha</h1>\n<p>During this period, several renowned disciples entered the monastic order, enriching the Sangha with their wisdom and dedication. Among them, the following events stand out as remarkable milestones in the history of the Dispensation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Ordination of Venerable R\u0101dha <span id=\"Endnote72\">[<a href=\"#endnote72\">72</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>According to the <i>Vinaya Pitaka</i>, <span id=\"Endnote73\">[<a href=\"#endnote73\">73</a>]</span> before his ordination, R\u0101dha was an elderly Brahmin from R\u0101jagaha. On one occasion, he humbly requested to become a monk, but the bhikkhus hesitated to accept him. When the Buddha learned of this, he inquired whether any among the Sangha remembered a good service rendered by the old Brahmin. Venerable S\u0101riputta then recalled a simple yet significant act\u2014R\u0101dha had once given him a spoonful of rice. Upon hearing this, the Buddha granted him permission for ordination, and Venerable S\u0101riputta became his preceptor.</p>\n<p>Despite his advanced age, Venerable R\u0101dha practiced diligently under his teacher\u2019s guidance. With unwavering effort, he soon attained arahantship, <span id=\"Endnote74\">[<a href=\"#endnote74\">74</a>]</span> demonstrating that spiritual liberation is not bound by age but by dedication and right effort.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\tOn this occasion, the Buddha extolled the virtue of <b>gratitude</b>, declaring that it is a hallmark of the <b>superior person (sappurisa)</b>\u2014one who recognizes and appreciates kindness.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\tAccording to another source, after R\u0101dha\u2019s ordination, Venerable S\u0101riputta took him to a quiet forest dwelling, sharing with him his four requisites. With proper care and support, the elderly monk regained his health, enabling him to practice with vigor. <span id=\"Endnote75\">[<a href=\"#endnote75\">75</a>]</span> Before long, his perseverance bore fruit, and he attained the supreme bliss of liberation.</p>\n<h2>Venerable Mah\u0101kassapa\u2019s Encounter with the Buddha </h2>\n<p>Another momentous event of this period was the ordination of Venerable Mah\u0101kassapa, one of the most eminent disciples of the Buddha. <span id=\"Endnote76\">[<a href=\"#endnote76\">76</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Born into a wealthy Brahmin family in Mah\u0101tittha, Magadha, <span id=\"Endnote77\">[<a href=\"#endnote77\">77</a>]</span> even before the birth of the Blessed One, he had a deep inclination toward renunciation. Realizing the suffering inherent in household life, he renounced the world in search of the truth.</p>\n<p>Mah\u0101kassapa described his first encounter with the Buddha with profound reverence:</p>\n<p><b>\u201c\u2026 As I wandered on my spiritual quest, I saw the Blessed One seated by the Bahuputta Shrine, between R\u0101jagaha and N\u0101land\u0101.

If ever I were to see a Perfectly Enlightened One, it would be this very Master.\u2019 Filled with devotion, I prostrated at his feet and declared: \u2018Venerable sir, the Blessed One is my teacher, and I am his disciple.\u2019\u201d</b> <span id=\"Endnote78\">[<a href=\"#endnote78\">78</a>]</span></p>\n<p>Recognizing Mah\u0101kassapa\u2019s sincerity, the Buddha accepted him into the monastic order and imparted a profound teaching:</p>\n<h3>The Importance of Listening to the Dhamma with an Open Heart</h3>\n<p><i>\u201cKassapa, you should train yourself thus: \u2018Whenever I listen to any teaching that is wholesome, I will listen with eager ears, regarding it as a matter of vital importance, applying my whole mind to it.

By the seventh day, his unwavering effort bore fruit\u2014he realized <b>arahantship</b>, fully liberated from all defilements.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\tOn this occasion, the Buddha, recognizing Mah\u0101kassapa\u2019s ascetic virtue, exchanged robes with him, signifying the deep spiritual bond between teacher and disciple.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Venerable Mah\u0101kassapa and the First Buddhist Council <span id=\"Endnote80\">[<a href=\"#endnote80\">80</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>After the Parinibb\u0101na of the Blessed One, Venerable Mah\u0101kassapa emerged as a steadfast guardian of the Dhamma. His leadership was crucial in preserving the teachings for future generations.</p>\n<p>As recorded in the <i>Vinaya Pitaka</i>, Mah\u0101kassapa was traveling from P\u0101v\u0101 to Kusin\u0101r\u0101 with a retinue of five hundred monks when he encountered a group of \u0100j\u012bvakas carrying coral-tree flowers. He inquired about the Blessed One\u2019s whereabouts, and they sorrowfully informed him that the Buddha had passed into final <b>Parinibb\u0101na</b> seven days earlier. <span id=\"Endnote81\">[<a href=\"#endnote81\">81</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Upon hearing this, the noble disciples accepted the truth with equanimity, understanding the impermanent nature of all conditioned things. However, some monks, overwhelmed with grief, wept inconsolably. Among them was Subhadda, an elderly monk, who responded with shocking irreverence:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cWhy grieve? Why lament? We are now free of that great ascetic! We were constantly restrained by his teachings\u2014always told what is allowed and what is not. Now, at last, we can do as we please!\u201d</i></p>\n<p>These words pierced Mah\u0101kassapa\u2019s heart. Recognizing the urgent need to protect the integrity of the Dhamma and the Vinaya, he called upon the Sangha, saying:</p>\n<p>\u201cLet us come together to recite the <b>Dhamma</b> and the <b>Monastic Discipline</b>, before corruption sets in.

In his <i>Therag\u0101th\u0101</i>, he expresses his liberation in these words:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cI am the son of the Buddha, the incomparable A\u1e45g\u012brasa,</p>\n<p>The unaffected, the bearer of the unbearable.</p>\n<p>You, Sakya, are my father\u2019s father;</p>\n<p>Gotama, you are my grandfather in the Dhamma</i>.\u201d (<i>Thag:10.1</i>)</p>\n<p>Though he had attained the highest liberation, K\u0101lud\u0101yi remained mindful of the mission he had undertaken in Kapilavatthu. Respectfully, he approached the Buddha and conveyed King Suddhodana\u2019s invitation to visit his homeland. In the <i>Therag\u0101th\u0101</i>, he poetically encourages the Buddha to make the journey:</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>The blossoming trees are delightful,</p>\n<p>Wafting their scent in all directions.</p>\n<p>They have shed their leaves and now long to bear fruit.</p>\n<p>Hero, it is time to depart.</p>\n<p>The season is neither too hot nor too cold,</p>\n<p>A pleasant time for travel.</p>\n<p>Let the S\u0101kyans and Koliyans see you,</p>\n<p>Crossing westward over the Rohi\u1e47\u012b River.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>This poetic description reflects not only the natural beauty of the path but also the spiritual significance of the journey\u2014a pilgrimage back to the roots of the Buddha\u2019s early life.</p>\n<p>According to tradition, <span id=\"Endnote93\">[<a href=\"#endnote93\">93</a>]</span>the Buddha took sixty days to complete the sixty-league journey from R\u0101jagaha to Kapilavatthu. Each day, K\u0101lud\u0101yi traveled by air to the king\u2019s palace to report on the Buddha\u2019s progress. He also brought back a bowl of the finest food from the palace to offer to the Buddha. By the time the Blessed One arrived in his homeland, his kinsmen were already filled with faith in him. Because of his remarkable service, K\u0101lud\u0101yi was declared pre-eminent among those who bring joy to their clans (<i>kulappas\u0101dak\u0101na\u1e43 aggo</i>).

It marked the beginning of new spiritual awakenings\u2014where princes, noblemen, and even the Buddha\u2019s own kin would embrace the path of renunciation, bringing the light of the Dhamma to Kapilavattu.</p>\n<h1>Reflections on This Period</h1>\n<p>These events reveal the extraordinary vitality of the Buddha\u2019s Dispensation during this time in R\u0101jagaha. We witness the emergence of remarkable disciples, each embodying a unique aspect of the Noble Path.</p>\n<p>Venerable S\u0101riputta shines with unparalleled wisdom, while Venerable Moggall\u0101na displays meditative mastery and supernormal powers. Despite his old age, Venerable R\u0101dha\u2019s unwavering determination carries him to the far shore of liberation. Venerable Mah\u0101kassapa exemplifies ascetic virtue, his deep spiritual connection with the Buddha honoured through the sacred exchange of robes. Venerable Upasena stands firm in unshakable confidence. The faithful friend K\u0101lud\u0101yi, though newly awakened as an arahant, does not waver in his mission to bring the Blessed One to Kapilavattu. The youthful Venerable Dabba Mallaputta reveals wisdom beyond his years.</p>\n<p>These stories continue to inspire seekers on the path, illuminating the noble qualities of faith, effort, and wisdom that lead to the highest goal\u2014liberation. They remind us that regardless of age, background, or circumstances, the path is open to all who strive with sincerity.</p>\n<p>With this reflection, we conclude this section. The next section (14-2) will focus on the events that unfolded in Kapilavatthu during the Buddha\u2019s visit to his homeland.</p>\n<h3>End Notes: Section 14-1</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<span id=\"endnote1\">[<a href=\"#Endnote1\">1</a>]</span>\t When he was an ascetic at age 29, he visited the city of Rajagaha and met King Bimbisara, see: section: 3.\n<p></p>\n<span id=\"endnote2\">[<a href=\"#Endnote2\">2</a>]</span>\t  VP: Mah\u0101kandaka 13: Monastic Law of Theravada School: Translated by Bhikkhu Brahmali .\n<p></p>\n<span id=\"endnote3\">[<a href=\"#Endnote3\">3</a>]</span>\t Source 1: Madhuratthavil\u0101sin\u012b (Buddhava\u1e41satthakath\u0101) of Bhadant\u00e2cariya Buddhadatta Mahathera: Translated by I.

However, to bridge the gap between the Buddha\u2019s arrival and R\u0101hula\u2019s ordination, <span id=\"Endnote7\">[<a href=\"#endnote7\">7</a>]</span> we have referred to additional sources. The events described in these sources are presented below.</p>\n<h2>The Buddha\u2019s Display of the Twin Miracle (Yamaka P\u0101\u1e6dih\u0101riya)</h2>\n<p>When the Buddha returned to his hometown, King Suddhodana and the Sakyan nobles extended an invitation for him and his Sangha to reside at the Banyan Tree Monastery (<i>Nigrodh\u0101r\u0101ma</i>). In honour of his arrival, the Sakyan families gathered to welcome him. We assume at that time; the Buddha was around thirty-six years old.<span id=\"Endnote8\">[<a href=\"#endnote8\">8</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Sakyans, known for their pride and noble lineage, had once seen the Buddha as a young prince. Out of deep-seated pride, the elder Sakyans hesitated to bow before him, leaving that act of reverence to their younger family members while they stood behind them. <span id=\"Endnote9\">[<a href=\"#endnote9\">9</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Yet the Buddha, ever compassionate and understanding, saw beyond their pride. He recognized that if they could develop faith in him, it would bring them immense benefit both in this life and beyond. To awaken their confidence, he performed the <i>Twin Miracle</i> (<i>Yamaka P\u0101\u1e6dih\u0101riya</i>), <span id=\"Endnote10\">[<a href=\"#endnote10\">10</a>]</span> a supreme display of supernormal power, in which he simultaneously emitted streams of fire and water from his body. This extraordinary sight filled the Sakyans with awe and reverence. In that moment, their doubt melted away, and they realized they stood before a Fully Enlightened One. Their pride gave way to faith, and with sincere devotion, they bowed before the Blessed One.</p>\n<p>It is said that on this auspicious occasion, Venerable S\u0101riputta, <span id=\"Endnote11\">[<a href=\"#endnote11\">11</a>]</span> witnessing the miracle, reflected:</p>\n<p><i>\"This is a moment fit for a profound Dhamma teaching. A discourse on the Buddhava\u1e41sa would be of great benefit, inspiring faith and devotion toward the Buddha.\"</i></p>\n<p>Thus, he respectfully requested the Buddha to recount his past lives and the long path of perfections he had fulfilled from the time he first received the definite prophecy of Buddhahood:</p>\n<p><b>Kidiso te Mah\u0101v\u012bra \u2013 abhinih\u0101ro naruttama</b></p>\n<p><b>Kmahi kale tay\u0101 dh\u012bra \u2013 pattit\u0101 Bodhimuttam\u0101</b></p>\n<p><i>\"Veneration to the Exalted One, who has undertaken the four great exertions, the one superior to men, devas, and Brahm\u0101s, the crown of the three worlds! In which world-cycle and in what distant aeon did you first aspire to attain Perfect Self-Enlightenment</i> <span id=\"Endnote12\">[<a href=\"#endnote12\">12</a>]</span>.</p>\n<h2>The Significance of Alms-Round for a Bhikkhu</h2>\n<p>One of the most profound moments in the Buddha\u2019s visit to Kapilavatthu was when he walked through the city for alms. News of this quickly reached King Suddhodana, who, feeling distressed and concerned for the dignity of his royal lineage, hurried to meet the Blessed One. <span id=\"Endnote13\">[<a href=\"#endnote13\">13</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>With a heart full of emotion, the King pleaded:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cMost Exalted One, why do you put us to shame by going from door to door for alms-food?\u201d</i></p>\n<p>The Buddha, with serene composure, replied:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cRoyal father, this practice of receiving alms from door to door is the sacred tradition upheld by an unbroken lineage of Buddhas.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>Still, the King insisted, reminding the Blessed One of his noble heritage:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cWe are of the Khattiya warrior lineage, and as my son, you too belong to this royal line.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>But the Buddha, with boundless compassion and wisdom, gently responded:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cO Royal Father, your lineage is that of Khattiyas, but my true ancestors are the Buddhas. This practice of seeking alms has always been the way of Buddhas past, present, and future\u2014it is not a sign of shame, but of humility and detachment.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>The Blessed One then offered a brief discourse on the importance of the alms-round, explaining that a bhikkhu, while receiving alms, should always conduct himself with dignity, mindfulness, and integrity. He should never seek alms through improper means, nor should he be attached to the food he receives. Instead, he should cultivate gratitude and mindfulness, recognizing that the practice of alms-giving benefits both the giver and the receiver.</p>\n<p><b>\u201cA bhikkhu who unfailingly practices this noble way of receiving alms will live in peace, both in this life and in the lives to come.\u201d</b><span id=\"Endnote14\">[<a href=\"#endnote14\">14</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>At the end of this discourse, King Suddhodana, deeply moved and filled with newfound wisdom, attained the state of stream-entry (<i>sot\u0101panna</i>), realizing the path to liberation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page14_2/image2.png\" />\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>Princess Yasodhara reciting the famous </b><b><i>Narasiha Stanzas </i></b><b>to her son R\u0101hula</b> <span id=\"Endnote15\">[<a href=\"#endnote15\">15</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Princess Yasodhara\u2019s Tribute and the Narasiha Stanzas</h2>\n<p>It is said that at this momentous occasion, Princess Yasodhara, watching from the palace balcony, recited the famous <i>Narasiha Stanzas</i>, a poetic tribute describing the supreme qualities of the Buddha. These verses, which remain a beloved chant in Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Burma, glorify the Buddha as the peerless being, the lion among men, who stands above all in wisdom and virtue. She recited these verses to her son, Prince R\u0101hula, instilling in him deep reverence for his father\u2014the Enlightened One. <span id=\"Endnote16\">[<a href=\"#endnote16\">16</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>The First Meal Offered by King Suddhodana</h2>\n<p>Following their encounter in the streets of Kapilavattu, King Suddhodana invited the Buddha and the Sangha for a meal at the royal palace the next day. After offering the meal with great devotion, the King and the royal family sat before the Blessed One, eager to receive his guidance. The Buddha then expounded on the proper way of receiving alms, emphasizing the importance of purity in both giving and receiving. The Buddha further explained the importance of giving alms: those who offer alms and dwell in the Dhamma live this life happily and gain a good rebirth. <span id=\"Endnote17\">[<a href=\"#endnote17\">17</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Let one live the Dhamma well and not live it wrongly. One who dwells in the Dhamma lives in happiness, both in this world and the next.</p>\n<p><i>( Dhamma\u1e41 care sucarita\u1e41 \u2013 na na\u1e41 ducarita\u1e41 care</p>\n<p>Dhammac\u0101ri sukha\u1e41 seti \u2013 asmim loke paramhi ca) </i></p>\n<p>Upon hearing this discourse, King Suddhodana reached an even higher realization\u2014attaining the noble state of non-returner (<i>an\u0101g\u0101mi</i>). The Buddha\u2019s stepmother, Mah\u0101paj\u0101pati Gotam\u012b <span id=\"Endnote18\">[<a href=\"#endnote18\">18</a>]</span> , too, experienced a profound spiritual awakening and entered the path as a stream-winner (<i>sot\u0101panna</i>).<span id=\"Endnote19\">[<a href=\"#endnote19\">19</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Princess Yasodhara\u2019s Devotion and the Chaddanta J\u0101taka</h2>\n<p>After the alms-offering at the palace, the Buddha visited Princess Yasodhara. Overcome with emotion, she paid homage to him in deep reverence. Seeing this, King Suddhodana spoke with great admiration of his daughter-in-law, revealing how, from the moment she learned that Prince Siddhartha had renounced the world, she too had abandoned her royal garments, donned simple robes, and lived a life of austerity in silent devotion.</p>\n<p>Hearing these words of praise, the Buddha, with a gentle smile, affirmed:</p>\n<p><b><i>\u201cNot only in this life but in past lives as well, Yasodhara was steadfast in virtue, unwavering in faith, and devoted in heart.\u201d</i></b></p>\n<p>He then recounted the <i>Chaddanta J\u0101taka</i>, <span id=\"Endnote20\">[<a href=\"#endnote20\">20</a>]</span> a past-life story that illustrated Yasodhara\u2019s noble qualities, showing how her unwavering support and virtuous conduct had been present across countless existences.</p>\n<p>This encounter reflects the deep wisdom, boundless compassion, and transformative power of the Buddha\u2019s teachings. It highlights the humility and mindfulness of the alms-round, the spiritual awakening of King Suddhodana, Mah\u0101paj\u0101pati Gotam\u012b  and the quiet strength of Princess Yasodhara\u2014all serving as timeless inspirations for those on the path.</p>\n<h2>The Third Day in Kapilavatthu \u2013 Prince Nanda\u2019s Renunciation</h2>\n<p>The third day of the Buddha\u2019s visit to Kapilavatthu was a momentous occasion for the royal family of King Suddhodana. The day was marked by a series of grand ceremonies\u2014Prince Nanda, the Buddha\u2019s half-brother, was being formally designated as heir to the throne, a magnificent residence was being bestowed upon him, and his marriage to the beautiful Princess Janapadakalyani was being celebrated.</p>\n<p>In the midst of these festivities, the Blessed One arrived at the royal palace, his serene presence bringing an air of profound stillness amid the revelry. After receiving alms, the Buddha delivered a discourse on the immeasurable benefits of meritorious deeds, reminding those present of the impermanence of worldly pleasures and the lasting refuge found in the Dhamma.</p>\n<p>At the end of the meal, in an act both simple and deeply symbolic, the Buddha handed his alms bowl to Prince Nanda and silently turned to leave. <span id=\"Endnote21\">[<a href=\"#endnote21\">21</a>]</span> Bound by deep respect, Nanda held the bowl and followed behind. As they walked together, the prince was filled with an inner conflict\u2014his attachment to sensual life- deep fondness to his wife to be the most beautiful maiden in the Sakyan country on one side, and the quiet pull of the respect and honour to his brother the Blessed One on the other.</p>\n<p>Step by step, he found himself drawn to the monastery. There, under the guiding presence of the Buddha, Prince Nanda was ordained as a bhikkhu, renouncing the opulent life that had just been laid before him.</p>\n<p>The scriptures recount how Nanda initially struggled with dissatisfaction in the monastic life, his mind still entangled in worldly attachments. But through the Buddha\u2019s boundless compassion and skilful guidance, he was led beyond fleeting desires, eventually attaining full liberation as an arahant. His journey remains a powerful testament to the transformative power of the Dhamma\u2014the path from worldly entanglement to the highest peace. <span id=\"Endnote22\">[<a href=\"#endnote22\">22</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>The Ordination of Prince R\u0101hula as a Novice</h2>\n<p>Another deeply significant event unfolded in Kapilavatthu\u2014the going forth of Prince R\u0101hula, the Buddha\u2019s only son. <span id=\"Endnote23\">[<a href=\"#endnote23\">23</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Seven days after Nanda\u2019s ordination, the Buddha once again visited the royal palace with the Sangha to receive alms. After the meal, as the Blessed One prepared to depart, young Prince R\u0101hula\u2014just a child at the time\u2014ran after him, gazing up at his father with innocent devotion.</p>\n<p>Turning to the Buddha, he spoke words that carried a depth beyond his years:</p>\n<p><b><i>\u201cAscetic, your shadow is pleasant.\u201d</i></b></p>\n<p>His mother, Princess Yasodhara, had instructed him well. Knowing that his father had once been heir to a great kingdom, she urged him to ask for his inheritance:</p>\n<p><b><i>\u201cGo and ask your father for your inheritance.\u201d</i></b></p>\n<p>With the eagerness of a child who trusts his father\u2019s love, R\u0101hula followed behind the Buddha, calling out:</p>\n<p><b><i>\u201cGive me my inheritance! Give me my inheritance!\u201d</i></b></p>\n<p>But the inheritance he sought was not of gold, jewels, or a kingdom. The Buddha, understanding the vast potential within the child, turned to his chief disciple and said: <span id=\"Endnote24\">[<a href=\"#endnote24\">24</a>]</span></p>\n<p><i>\u201cWell then, S\u0101riputta, give R\u0101hula the going forth.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>Thus, Venerable S\u0101riputta ordained the young prince as a novice monk (<i>s\u0101ma\u1e47era</i>), marking the beginning of R\u0101hula\u2019s noble journey on the path of wisdom and virtue.</p>\n<p>This event is recorded in the <i>Vinaya Pitaka</i>,<span id=\"Endnote25\">[<a href=\"#endnote25\">25</a>]</span> where it is noted that on this occasion, the Buddha also established an important rule\u2014henceforth, a child could only be ordained with the consent of their parents. This compassionate regulation ensured that the path of renunciation would be undertaken with wisdom and respect for familial bonds.</p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page14_2/image3.png\" />\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>Prince R\u0101hula asking his inheritance from the Buddha </b><span id=\"Endnote26\">[<a href=\"#endnote26\">26</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>The Profound Legacy of the Buddha\u2019s Visit to Kapilavatthu</h2>\n<p>With these remarkable events\u2014the renunciation of Prince Nanda, the ordination of young R\u0101hula, and the deep spiritual transformations within the royal family\u2014the Blessed One\u2019s visit to his hometown was filled with wonder and significance. Each moment reflected the power of the Dhamma to awaken minds, shift perspectives, and open the doors to liberation.</p>\n<p>It was here, among his own kin, that the Buddha revealed profound truths about the fleeting nature of worldly attachments and the boundless peace found in the noble path. With the seeds of awakening now planted in Kapilavattu, the Blessed One prepared to depart\u2014his journey would soon lead him back to R\u0101jagaha, where countless more would encounter the liberating light of his teachings.</p>\n<p>With the above note we can conclude the wonderful and marvellous Dhamma events happened during the visit of the Blessed One at his hometown in Kappilavattu. The next significant event was his going back from Kapilavattu to R\u0101jagaha.</p>\n<h1>The Fifth Walking Tour of the Buddha</h1>\n<p>Having spent time in Kapilavatthu and guiding his parents toward noble attainments, the Blessed One, accompanied by a large assembly of Bhikkhus, departed from his hometown and set forth on his journey toward R\u0101jagaha.

This barber Up\u0101li has served us faithfully for many years. Please ordain him first, so that we may bow to him, rise in his presence, and show him due respect.

Only afterward were the six princes accepted into the Sangha, marking a profound moment of renunciation and spiritual humility. <span id=\"Endnote33\">[<a href=\"#endnote33\">33</a>]</span></p>\n<h2>The Ordination of Seven-Year-Old Dabba Mallaputta as a Novice</h2>\n<p>During the Buddha\u2019s stay at Anupiya Mango Grove, a remarkable event unfolded. A young boy named Dabba Mallaputta, merely seven years old, visited the Blessed One in the company of his grandmother. Overcome with joy and devotion upon seeing the Buddha, the child earnestly requested permission to ordain. <span id=\"Endnote34\">[<a href=\"#endnote34\">34</a>]</span> With his grandmother\u2019s consent, the Buddha instructed the monks to ordain the boy as a novice.</p>\n<p>Astonishingly, as the first lock of his hair was shaved, young Dabba attained stream-entry (sot\u0101panna). By the time his head was completely shaved, he had realized full arahantship\u2014achieving the highest liberation at such a tender age. <span id=\"Endnote35\">[<a href=\"#endnote35\">35</a>]</span> Later, he travelled to R\u0101jagaha and took residence at Veluvana Monastery, where he continued to serve the Sangha with exceptional qualities.</p>\n<p>The <b>Vinaya Pi\u1e6daka</b> records this extraordinary attainment as follows: <span id=\"Endnote36\">[<a href=\"#endnote36\">36</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\"At one time, when the Buddha was staying at R\u0101jagaha in the Bamboo Grove, Venerable Dabba the Mallian realized perfection at the age of seven.\"</i></p>\n<h2>The Spiritual Progress of the Seven Bhikkhus from Kapilavattu</h2>\n<p>The Anupiya Mango Grove also became the setting for the remarkable spiritual growth of the newly ordained monks.

This period of spiritual advancement likely took place during the Buddha\u2019s second rainy retreat in R\u0101jagaha.</p>\n<h3>Reflections on the Significance of Anupiya Mango Grove</h3>\n<p>Anupiya Mango Grove stands as a sacred witness to the power of renunciation, humility, and swift spiritual attainment. It was here that pride was humbled, faith was deepened, and the seeds of enlightenment blossomed. From the ordination of Up\u0101li to the miraculous arahantship of young Dabba Mallaputta, this place reminds us that the Dhamma is beyond caste, status, or age\u2014it is open to all who earnestly seek liberation.</p>\n<p>May these inspiring accounts continue to illuminate the path for all beings!</p>\n<h3>Venerable Bhaddiya: The First Arahant Among the Seven Sakyan Bhikkhus</h3>\n<p>According to the Vinaya Pi\u1e6daka,<i> </i><span id=\"Endnote38\">[<a href=\"#endnote38\">38</a>]</span> Venerable Bhaddiya, <span id=\"Endnote39\">[<a href=\"#endnote39\">39</a>]</span> through the realization of the threefold knowledge (<i>tevijj\u0101</i>), attained arahantship during his very first rainy season as a bhikkhu. Among the seven Sakyan nobles who had renounced the world to follow the Blessed One, he was the first to reach this noble state of full liberation.</p>\n<h2>Ah, Happiness! Ah, Happiness!\"\u2014A Realization of True Security</h2>\n<p>The Ud\u0101na (Inspired Utterances of the Buddha) recounts a profound moment in Bhaddiya\u2019s journey: <span id=\"Endnote40\">[<a href=\"#endnote40\">40</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>While the Blessed One was residing at Anupiya Mango Grove, some bhikkhus noticed that Venerable Bhaddiya, after retreating to the forest, would often exclaim, <i>\u201cAh, happiness! Ah, happiness!\u201d</i> Curious about this, they reported the matter to the Buddha, who then summoned Bhaddiya and inquired:</p>\n<p><i>\"Bhaddiya, is it true that you often utter this exclamation while dwelling alone in the wilderness?\"</i></p>\n<p><i>\"Yes, Venerable Sir.\"</i></p>\n<p><i>\"But, Bhaddiya, on what grounds do you exclaim, \u2018Ah, happiness! Ah, happiness!\u2019?\"</i></p>\n<p>Venerable Bhaddiya then revealed his profound realization:</p>\n<p><i>\"In the past, when I was a ruler, my royal chambers were heavily guarded\u2014inside and out\u2014yet I lived in constant fear, anxiety, and distrust. Even with all that protection, I was never truly at ease. But now, dwelling in the solitude of the forest, free from attachments, I am utterly fearless, untroubled, and at peace. My mind is unwavering and secure, like that of a free-born animal. It is for this reason, Venerable Sir, that I exclaim, \u2018Ah, happiness! Ah, happiness!\u2019\"</i></p>\n<p>Hearing this, the Buddha rejoiced in Bhaddiya\u2019s spiritual happiness and uttered the following inspired verse:</p>\n<p><i>\"They who have no anger within,</i></p>\n<p><i>Gone beyond any kind of existence,</i></p>\n<p><i>Happy, free from fear and sorrow\u2014</i></p>\n<p><i>Even the gods are unable to see them.\u201d </i><span id=\"Endnote41\">[<a href=\"#endnote41\">41</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Thus, Venerable Bhaddiya\u2019s story stands as a radiant testimony to the peace and fearlessness that arise from true renunciation. Even kings, surrounded by luxury and guards, remain prisoners of fear, while an arahant, dwelling alone in the wilderness, abides in supreme security and joy.</p>\n<h2>Venerable Up\u0101li: The Supreme Upholder of the Discipline</h2>\n<p>Among the great disciples of the Buddha, Venerable Up\u0101li was renowned as the foremost authority on the Vinaya (Monastic Discipline). <span id=\"Endnote42\">[<a href=\"#endnote42\">42</a>]</span> Recognizing his keen intellect and natural inclination for meticulous learning, the Blessed One personally encouraged him to master the Vinaya.</p>\n<h2>The Buddha\u2019s Guidance on the Path to Awakening</h2>\n<p>At one point, before attaining final liberation, Venerable Up\u0101li sought the Buddha\u2019s permission to dwell alone in a remote forest retreat to intensify his practice. However, the Buddha, understanding the challenges of solitude for one who had not yet reached noble attainment, cautioned him: <span id=\"Endnote43\">[<a href=\"#endnote43\">43</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\"Up\u0101li, to live in seclusion in the deep forest requires great inner strength. Without the firm foundation of noble attainment, one cannot easily endure the solitude. There are ten essential qualities necessary for such a life.\"</i></p>\n<p>The Buddha then elaborated on these ten qualities, guiding Up\u0101li to first strengthen his wisdom and practice while remaining within the Sangha. <span id=\"Endnote44\">[<a href=\"#endnote44\">44</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In another instance, the Buddha gave Up\u0101li a profound teaching on discerning the true Dhamma: <span id=\"Endnote45\">[<a href=\"#endnote45\">45</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\"Up\u0101li, those teachings that do not lead to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to peace, to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibb\u0101na\u2014recognize them as not the true Dhamma, not the teaching of the Teacher. But those teachings that lead exclusively to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to peace, to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibb\u0101na\u2014know with certainty: This is the Dhamma; this is the discipline; this is the teaching of the Teacher.\"</i></p>\n<p>Through diligent practice and deep reflection on these teachings, Venerable Up\u0101li eventually attained arahantship, becoming an undisputed master of the Vinaya.</p>\n<h2>Venerable Up\u0101li\u2019s Legacy in Preserving the Vinaya</h2>\n<p>The Vinaya Pi\u1e6daka describes how the Buddha frequently praised Venerable Up\u0101li for his expertise in monastic law: <span id=\"Endnote46\">[<a href=\"#endnote46\">46</a>]</span></p>\n<p><i>\"At one time, the Buddha gave many talks on the Monastic Law, repeatedly emphasizing its importance. He extolled the virtue of learning it well and often commended Venerable Up\u0101li. Inspired by this, monks of all ranks\u2014both senior and junior\u2014sought to learn the Monastic Law from Venerable Up\u0101li.\"</i></p>\n<p>His mastery of Vinaya was not only beneficial for his own spiritual practice but also for the longevity and purity of the Buddha\u2019s Dispensation.</p>\n<h2>The First Buddhist Council: Guardian of the Vinaya</h2>\n<p>After the Buddha\u2019s Parinibb\u0101na, the preservation of the Dhamma and Vinaya became of utmost importance. At the First Buddhist Council, held in R\u0101jagaha, Venerable Up\u0101li played a crucial role:<i> </i><span id=\"Endnote47\">[<a href=\"#endnote47\">47</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\"The senior monks gathered in R\u0101jagaha to recite the Dhamma and the Monastic Law.

Bhaddiya\u2019s story reveals how true happiness and fearlessness arise not from external security, but from inner liberation. Up\u0101li\u2019s life exemplifies the importance of discipline, wisdom, and the careful preservation of the Buddha\u2019s teachings.</p>\n<p>Their legacies continue to inspire those who seek the path of renunciation, wisdom, and unwavering commitment to the Dhamma.</p>\n<p>May their noble virtues serve as an encouragement for all who aspire to the path of liberation!</p>\n<h2>Venerable Anuruddha: The Divine Eye and the Noble Path</h2>\n<p>Among the great disciples of the Blessed One, Venerable Anuruddha was renowned for his divine eye (<i>dibba-cakkhu</i>), the supernormal vision that allowed him to perceive a thousand world systems. This profound attainment was the fruit of his deep meditation and unwavering dedication to the path. <span id=\"Endnote48\">[<a href=\"#endnote48\">48</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>The Eight Thoughts of a Great Person: A Turning Point in His Practice</h3>\n<p>After spending his first rainy season as a bhikkhu, Venerable Anuruddha attained mastery over deep meditative absorptions and developed the divine eye. Seeking further spiritual progress, he journeyed to Ceti country, dwelling in the Eastern Bamboo Park. There, he spent eight months absorbed in intense meditation. <span id=\"Endnote49\">[<a href=\"#endnote49\">49</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>During his time in solitude, a remarkable transformation occurred\u2014<b>eight thoughts of a great person</b> arose in his mind, elevating his insight.

Therefore, Anuruddha, remain here for the next rains retreat among the Cetis in the Eastern Bamboo Park.\" <span id=\"Endnote51\">[<a href=\"#endnote51\">51</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Receiving the Buddha\u2019s words with boundless joy, Venerable Anuruddha devoted himself even more earnestly to meditation. Dwelling alone\u2014heedful, ardent, and resolute\u2014he attained full enlightenment and became an arahant. On the occasion of his awakening, he expressed his deep gratitude to the Buddha in verse:</p>\n<p><b><i>\"Having learned his Dhamma,</i></b><i> </i><b><i>I delighted in his teaching.</i></b><i></p>\n<p></i><b><i>I have gained the three true knowledges;</i></b><i> </i><b><i>the Buddha\u2019s teaching has been fulfilled</i></b><b>.\"</b><span id=\"Endnote52\">[<a href=\"#endnote52\">52</a>]</span><b> </b></p>\n<p>Thus, his life became a testament to the power of dedication, solitude, and the unwavering guidance of the Teacher.</p>\n<h2>The Noble Companionship of Anuruddha, Nandiya, and Kimbila</h2>\n<p>The C\u016b\u1e37agosinga Sutta (MN: 31) recounts a remarkable meeting between the Blessed One and three noble monks\u2014Anuruddha, Nandiya, and Kimbila\u2014who were dwelling together in perfect harmony at the Gosinga S\u0101la-tree Wood. <span id=\"Endnote53\">[<a href=\"#endnote53\">53</a>]</span></p>\n<p>When the Buddha arrived, he was greeted with deep reverence.

According to tradition and scriptural accounts, the Buddha spent his second to fourth vassa in and around R\u0101jagaha, deepening the dissemination of the Dhamma and offering invaluable guidance to both monastics and lay followers.</p>\n<h2>Significant Events During This Period</h2>\n<h3>Dhamma Advice Given to Novice R\u0101hula</h3>\n<p>During his second vassa at the Veluvana Monastery, the Blessed One offered profound teachings to Venerable R\u0101hula, who was residing in Ambalatthik\u0101 at the time. <span id=\"Endnote1\">[<a href=\"#endnote1\">1</a>]</span>  Knowing that R\u0101hula had taken up the monastic path at a tender age, the Buddha imparted essential lessons that would serve as the foundation of his spiritual journey.</p>\n<h3>Key Teachings</h3>\n<h4>The Peril of Falsehood</h4>\n<p>Using the simile of a pot, the Buddha emphasized the dire consequences of speaking falsehood: <span id=\"Endnote2\">[<a href=\"#endnote2\">2</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\tJust as a pot containing only a little water is nearly empty, even so, one who is unashamed to utter a deliberate lie has diminished their spiritual life.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\tJust as water poured out of a pot is lost, even so, one who tells deliberate lies has discarded the path of a recluse.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\tJust as an upturned pot can hold nothing, even so, one who tells deliberate lies has overturned their commitment to the holy life.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\tJust as an empty pot stands hollow and void, even so, is the recluse-ship of one who speaks falsehood without shame.</p>\n<p>Thus, the Blessed One urged:\u00a0<i>\u201c</i><b><i>Therefore, R\u0101hula, you should train yourself thus: \u2018I will not utter a falsehood even as a joke.\u2019</i></b><span id=\"Endnote3\">[<a href=\"#endnote3\">3</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h4>Mindfulness in Bodily, Verbal, and Mental Actions</h4>\n<p>The Buddha further guided Venerable R\u0101hula on the necessity of wise reflection before engaging in any action. Using the simile of a mirror, he illustrated that just as one examines one\u2019s reflection in a mirror, so too should one examine one\u2019s thoughts, words, and deeds with careful introspection.</p>\n<p>The Buddha advised:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cR\u0101hula, when you wish to perform an action by body, speech, or mind, you should reflect: \u2018Would this action lead to my own affliction, to the affliction of others, or to the affliction of both? Is it an unwholesome action with painful consequences and results?\u2019 If, upon reflection, you discern that such an action would lead to harm, you should refrain from it.\u201d</i><span id=\"Endnote4\">[<a href=\"#endnote4\">4</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>Furthermore</b>, the Blessed One expounded that one should reflect\u00a0<b>before</b>,\u00a0<b>during</b>, and\u00a0<b>after</b>\u00a0an action to assess its wholesomeness. If, upon honest reflection, one recognizes an action as unwholesome, immediate correction should follow. Even if the deed is already done, the practitioner should feel sincere remorse, resolve never to repeat it, and seek guidance from a senior member of the Sa\u1e41gha through confession. In this way, one grows in the discipline of the Noble Ones, refining their virtue and wisdom.</p>\n<h2>A Legacy of Discipline and Reflection</h2>\n<p>These teachings imparted to Venerable R\u0101hula encapsulate the essence of the Dhamma\u2014<b>purity of speech, clarity of thought, and mindfulness in action</b>. They serve as an enduring reminder that the path to awakening is paved with unwavering honesty, deep introspection, and a relentless commitment to ethical conduct. The Blessed One, through his infinite compassion, laid a luminous path for his disciples, guiding them toward a life of truth, wisdom, and liberation.</p>\n<p>May we, too, strive to embody these timeless teachings, nurturing within ourselves the noble qualities that lead to the highest peace!</p>\n<h2>The Importance of Offering Dwellings to the Sangha</h2>\n<p>Another significant event during this time was the introduction of monastic dwellings for the Sangha. Up until this point, the Buddha had not yet allowed permanent residences for monks during the rainy season retreat. <span id=\"Endnote5\">[<a href=\"#endnote5\">5</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A wealthy merchant from R\u0101jagaha, <span id=\"Endnote6\">[<a href=\"#endnote6\">6</a>]</span>  moved by deep devotion and generosity, approached the Blessed One and expressed his wish to offer shelter for the Sangha. Upon receiving the Buddha\u2019s consent, the merchant, with great enthusiasm and effort, constructed sixty dwellings in a single day. The next day, he invited the Buddha and the Sangha to his home for a meal offering. After making the offering, he formally presented the sixty dwellings to the Blessed One and the monastic community.</p>\n<p>In recognition of this meritorious act, the Buddha expressed his appreciation in verse:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cGiving dwellings to the Sangha</i></p>\n<p><i>Is praised as the best by the Buddha.</i></p>\n<p><i>Therefore, the wise man,</i></p>\n<p><i>Seeing what\u2019s beneficial for himself,</i></p>\n<p><i>Should build delightful dwellings</i></p>\n<p><i>And have the learned stay there.\u201d </i><span id=\"Endnote7\">[<a href=\"#endnote7\">7</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This moment marked a crucial development in the monastic tradition, ensuring that monks had a stable place to dwell, practice, and propagate the Dhamma. <b>Offering such dwellings became recognized as one of the highest forms of merit,</b> as it not only provided material support but also created a conducive environment for the continuation of the noble teachings.</p>\n<p>The generosity of the merchant highlights the power of wise giving (d\u0101na). Providing shelter for the Sangha is not merely an act of charity but an offering that nourishes the Dhamma itself, ensuring its survival for future generations. Such meritorious deeds bring boundless benefit, fostering peace and wisdom in the giver, the recipient, and all who come into contact with the teachings.</p>\n<h2>An\u0101thapi\u1e47\u1e0dika\u2019s First Encounter with the Buddha</h2>\n<p>The Vinaya Pi\u1e6daka provides a vivid and inspiring account of the first meeting between An\u0101thapi\u1e47\u1e0dika and the Blessed One. <span id=\"Endnote8\">[<a href=\"#endnote8\">8</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>An\u0101thapi\u1e47\u1e0dika, <span id=\"Endnote9\">[<a href=\"#endnote9\">9</a>]</span> a wealthy and devout merchant from S\u0101vatth\u012b, had come to R\u0101jagaha on business and was staying with his brother-in-law, the same generous benefactor who had just offered sixty dwellings to the Sa\u1e41gha. He noticed that his relative was deeply engaged in preparations and inquired about the special occasion. The brother-in-law joyfully revealed:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cI have invited the Sa\u1e41gha, headed by the Buddha, for a meal tomorrow.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>Upon hearing the word \u2018<b>Buddha</b>,\u2019 An\u0101thapi\u1e47\u1e0dika was overcome with profound joy and astonishment. He eagerly asked:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cDid you say \u2018Buddha\u2019?\u201d</i></p>\n<p><i>\u201cI did.\u201d</i></p>\n<p><i>\u201cDid you say \u2018Buddha\u2019?\u201d</i></p>\n<p><i>\u201cI did.\u201d</i></p>\n<p><i>\u201cDid you say \u2018Buddha\u2019?\u201d</i></p>\n<p><i>\u201cI did.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>He exclaimed, <i>\u201cIt is rare indeed to hear the word \u2018Buddha\u2019 in this world! Is it possible to visit him now, this Fully Awakened One?\u201d</i></p>\n<p>His brother-in-law advised that it was too late in the evening, but he could go in the morning. Yet, such was An\u0101thapi\u1e47\u1e0dika\u2019s eagerness that he could hardly sleep that night, his heart filled with anticipation. In the deep of night, when he attempted to venture out, he was overcome with fear. At that moment, a benevolent spirit, wishing for his welfare, encouraged him:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cGo forward, householder, go forward!</i></p>\n<p><i>Going forward is better for you than going back.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>At that time, the Blessed One was staying at S\u012btavana, the Cool Grove, engaged in walking meditation. As An\u0101thapi\u1e47\u1e0dika approached, the Buddha, perceiving his sincerity, warmly called out:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cCome, Sudatta.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>Hearing his name spoken by the Blessed One, An\u0101thapi\u1e47\u1e0dika was overwhelmed with joy. He rushed forward, prostrated before the Buddha, and respectfully inquired:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cSir, I hope you have slept well?\u201d</i></p>\n<p>To which the Buddha replied:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cAfter cutting all attachments,</i></p>\n<p><i>After removing distress from the heart,</i></p>\n<p><i>Calmed, he sleeps well,</i></p>\n<p><i>Having attained peace of mind.\u201d </i><span id=\"Endnote10\">[<a href=\"#endnote10\">10</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>On that very occasion, the Blessed One delivered a progressive Dhamma discourse on generosity, virtue, and wisdom. As An\u0101thapi\u1e47\u1e0dika\u2019s mind became ripe for higher understanding, he attained the stainless vision of Truth\u2014realizing:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cAnything that has a beginning has an end.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>Thus, in his first encounter with the Buddha, An\u0101thapi\u1e47\u1e0dika attained stream-entry. Filled with faith, he invited the Buddha and the Sangha for a meal at his brother-in-law\u2019s home and later extended an invitation for the Sangha to spend the rainy-season retreat in S\u0101vatth\u012b.<span id=\"Endnote11\">[<a href=\"#endnote11\">11</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>An\u0101thapi\u1e47\u1e0dika\u2019s Offering of Jetavana Monastery to the Buddha and the Sangha</h2>\n<p>The <i>Vinaya Pi\u1e6daka</i> elaborates on this remarkable event: <span id=\"Endnote12\">[<a href=\"#endnote12\">12</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>After completing his business in R\u0101jagaha, An\u0101thapi\u1e47\u1e0dika set out for S\u0101vatth\u012b. Along the way, he encouraged his many friends and acquaintances\u2014who highly valued his advice\u2014to build monasteries, construct dwellings, and prepare offerings. He proclaimed with great joy,</p>\n<p><i>\u201cThere is a Buddha in the world! I have invited him, and he will soon be traveling this way.\u201d</i> Inspired by his words, the people responded wholeheartedly, making generous preparations for the Blessed One\u2019s arrival.</p>\n<p>Upon reaching S\u0101vatth\u012b, An\u0101thapi\u1e47\u1e0dika sought a suitable place where the Buddha and the Sangha could reside. He soon found a beautiful park belonging to Prince Jeta, which possessed all the ideal qualities for a monastery. Without delay, he approached the prince with a request:</p>\n<p><b>\u201c</b><i>Sir, please grant me your park to establish a monastery.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>Prince Jeta, unaware of the depth of An\u0101thapi\u1e47\u1e0dika\u2019s devotion, replied with amusement:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cI would not give it away even if you covered the entire park with ten million gold coins.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>Without hesitation, An\u0101thapi\u1e47\u1e0dika responded, <i>\u201cIt\u2019s a deal!\u201d</i></p>\n<p>Surprised, the prince quickly interjected, <i>\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t!\u201d</i></p>\n<p>To resolve the matter, they sought the judgment of legal authorities, who ruled:</p>\n<p>\u201cSince you named a price, the land is sold.\u201d</p>\n<p>Rejoicing in his success, An\u0101thapi\u1e47\u1e0dika wasted no time. He brought out carts filled with gold coins and began covering the entire Jetavana Grove. Coin by coin, he spread his wealth until twenty million pieces of gold glistened in the park. However, a small area remained uncovered. As he was instructing his men to bring more coins, Prince Jeta, deeply moved by the sincerity of this offering, stopped him.</p>\n<p>Seeing the immense devotion behind this act, Prince Jeta reflected:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cIf he is willing to give away such a vast fortune, this must truly be something of great worth.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>Recognizing the significance of the monastery\u2019s construction, he declared:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cThat is enough, householder. Do not cover that remaining area. Let me offer it as my own gift.\u201d</i><span id=\"Endnote13\">[<a href=\"#endnote13\">13</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Thus, Prince Jeta, too, had the great fortune of participating in this extraordinary deed of generosity.</p>\n<h2>The Grand Construction of Jetavana Monastery</h2>\n<p>Both tradition and the scriptures describe the meticulous planning and construction of the monastery:</p>\n<p>An\u0101thapi\u1e47\u1e0dika ensured that the Jeta Grove was transformed into a magnificent sanctuary. He had built spacious courtyards, well-guarded gatehouses, elegant assembly halls, and dedicated areas for preparing food and storing requisites. He commissioned walking meditation paths\u2014both open-air and covered\u2014along with well-constructed restrooms, saunas, ponds, and wells. Every detail was carefully attended to, leaving nothing lacking for the comfort and well-being of the Sangha.</p>\n<p><b>According to another source:</b> <span id=\"Endnote14\">[<a href=\"#endnote14\">14</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\"Having purchased Prince Jeta\u2019s park at the cost of eighteen crores of gold coins, An\u0101thapi\u1e47\u1e0dika spent another eighteen crores to construct a splendid monastery upon it. At its heart stood the perfumed chamber (Gandhakuti), the Buddha\u2019s personal residence, surrounded by elegant dwellings for the Bhikkhu Sangha. Stately seven-tiered archways adorned the monastery, along with grand assembly halls, storerooms for allowable articles, well-roofed water wells, and carefully designed bathhouses for both cool and sweat baths. Square water tanks and beautifully crafted pavilions were also built, ensuring that nothing essential was overlooked.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>Thus, through his unwavering devotion and unmatched generosity, An\u0101thapi\u1e47\u1e0dika created one of the most celebrated monasteries in history\u2014a sacred refuge where the Buddha expounded the Dhamma and guided countless beings toward liberation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page14_3/image1.jpeg\" />\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>Present day picture of Mulagandhakuti.

The <i>Vinaya Pi\u1e6daka</i> recounts<i>\u201d</i><span id=\"Endnote16\">[<a href=\"#endnote16\">16</a>]</span><i> </i> how the Buddha, filled with kindness, graciously accepted the invitation and set forth for S\u0101vatth\u012b, accompanied by a large assembly of monks.</p>\n<p>The sacred journey of the Buddha was not merely a physical movement from one place to another\u2014it was a journey of wisdom, compassion, and transformation. As he wandered from town to town, many came to see him, to listen, and to seek the path to liberation. Finally, he arrived at S\u0101vatth\u012b and took residence in the serene Jeta Grove, now known as <i>An\u0101thapi\u1e47\u1e0dika\u2019s Park</i>.</p>\n<p>The <i>Vinaya Pi\u1e6daka</i> describes the moment when An\u0101thapi\u1e47\u1e0dika, radiant with devotion, approached the Buddha:<span id=\"Endnote17\">[<a href=\"#endnote17\">17</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\"An\u0101thapi\u1e47\u1e0dika then went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, and said, \u2018Sir, please accept tomorrow\u2019s meal from me together with the Sangha of monks.\u2019\u201d</i></p>\n<p>The next day, with his own hands, An\u0101thapi\u1e47\u1e0dika reverently offered food to the Buddha and the assembled monks. It was not just an offering of nourishment but a profound act of faith and generosity, symbolizing his dedication to the Buddha and the Dhamma. After the meal, with great humility, he requested the Blessed One to accept the Jetavana monastery as a gift.</p>\n<p>The Buddha, in his wisdom, responded with a directive that would ensure the monastery\u2019s lasting benefit:</p>\n<p><b>\u201cYou should dedicate the Jeta Grove to the Sangha as a whole, both present and future.\u201d</b><span id=\"Endnote18\">[<a href=\"#endnote18\">18</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Thus, the monastery was not given to a single individual but to the entire community of Sangha\u2014those who were present and those yet to come\u2014so that the Dhamma could continue to flourish for generations.</p>\n<h3>The Buddha\u2019s Words of Appreciation</h3>\n<p>Having received the Jetavana Monastery, the Buddha expressed his deep appreciation through these profound verses:</p>\n<p>\"Giving dwellings to the Sangha</p>\n<p>Is praised as the highest offering by the Buddha.</p>\n<p>Therefore, the wise,</p>\n<p>Seeing what is truly beneficial,</p>\n<p>Should build delightful dwellings</p>\n<p>And invite the learned to stay there.</p>\n<p>Food, drink, robes, and shelter\u2014</p>\n<p>With an inspired heart,</p>\n<p>He should offer these to the upright ones.</p>\n<p>In return, they will share the Teaching,</p>\n<p>Which leads to the end of suffering.</p>\n<p>And understanding this Teaching in this very life,</p>\n<p>He attains extinguishment, free from all defilements.\u201d<span id=\"Endnote19\">[<a href=\"#endnote19\">19</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>These verses reveal a timeless truth: generosity towards the Sangha is not merely an act of giving\u2014it is a gateway to wisdom and liberation. In supporting those who walk the path of Dhamma, one cultivates merit that leads not only to worldly happiness but to the ultimate freedom from suffering.</p>\n<p>Thus, the offering of Jetavana was far more than the donation of land and buildings. It became a sacred refuge\u2014a place where countless beings would hear the Buddha\u2019s teachings, contemplate the Dhamma, and take steps toward the highest peace, <i>Nibb\u0101na</i>.</p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page14_3/image2.png\" />\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>The Blessed One walking in the Jetavana Monastery </b><span id=\"Endnote20\">[<a href=\"#endnote20\">20</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>The Grand Ceremony of Offering Jetavana Monastery</h2>\n<p>Another source provides additional details about the grand event of offering and dedicating Jetavana Monastery: <span id=\"Endnote21\">[<a href=\"#endnote21\">21</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\"An\u0101thapi\u1e47\u1e0dika, having made all the necessary preparations for a magnificent ceremony to formally offer and dedicate the monastery to the Buddha, arranged for the symbolic pouring of water as a gesture of devotion.

Likewise, when they are reborn as human beings, the generous one excels in five ways: in human lifespan, human beauty, human happiness, human fame, and human influence.\"</p>\n<p>At the conclusion of this discourse, the Blessed One affirmed the significance of generosity with these words:</p>\n<p><i>\"So it is, Suman\u0101! So it is, Suman\u0101! Truly, one has good reason to give alms and perform meritorious deeds, for such acts bear fruit\u2014whether one is reborn among devas, among humans, or embarks upon the spiritual path.\"</i></p>\n<p>This teaching reveals the far-reaching impact of generosity\u2014not only in bringing immediate joy but also in shaping one\u2019s future existence. Giving is never wasted; it enriches the giver in this life and beyond, leading ultimately to the highest happiness\u2014the complete liberation of the mind.</p>\n<h1>The War Between the Sakyans and Koliyans: The Buddha\u2019s Intervention for Peace</h1>\n<p>According to tradition and the commentaries, a great conflict once arose between the Sakyans and the Koliyans over the use of water from the Rohini River.<b> </b><span id=\"Endnote30\">[<a href=\"#endnote30\">30</a>]</span><b> </b> Both clans, proud of their heritage and strength, were prepared to wage war against each other. Although this incident is not explicitly mentioned in the canonical scriptures, it beautifully illustrates the Buddha\u2019s supreme commitment to peace and harmony. For this reason, we find it fitting to include it here. <span id=\"Endnote31\">[<a href=\"#endnote31\">31</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>The Buddha\u2019s Vision of an Impending War</h3>\n<p>While residing in Jetavana Monastery in S\u0101vatth\u012b, the Buddha surveyed the world at dawn and saw that a battle was imminent. By evening, blood would be spilled between his own kinsmen\u2014the Sakyans, his paternal relatives, and the Koliyans, his maternal relatives. Moved by great compassion, he resolved to intervene and prevent the destruction of both sides.</p>\n<p>Without delay, the Buddha travelled to the banks of the Rohini River, where the two armies stood poised for battle. As tensions mounted, he performed an extraordinary feat\u2014he ascended into the sky and seated himself in mid-air, directly between the warring factions.</p>\n<h3>A Moment of Reflection: The Power of the Buddha\u2019s Presence</h3>\n<p>The sight of the Blessed One hovering above them was enough to stir the conscience of both clans. The Sakyans, upon seeing him, thought:</p>\n<p><i>\"It would be unthinkable to raise our weapons against others in the presence of the Buddha. Let the Koliyans defeat us or take us captive if they wish, but we shall not fight.\"</i></p>\n<p>The Koliyans, witnessing this change of heart, arrived at the same conclusion. By mutual consent, they dropped their weapons and bowed in homage to the Buddha. Peace replaced hostility in an instant. The Buddha then descended and seated himself on the sandy riverbank, now transformed into a place of reverence and unity.</p>\n<h3>The Buddha\u2019s Words of Wisdom</h3>\n<p>Seizing this moment of clarity, the Buddha asked:</p>\n<p><i>\"What is the worth of the water of the Rohini River?\"</i></p>\n<p>The assembled clans responded:</p>\n<p><i>\"Exalted Buddha, its value is insignificant.\"</i></p>\n<p>The Buddha then asked:</p>\n<p><i>\"And what of the earth\u2014what is its value?\"</i></p>\n<p><i>\"Its value is limitless,\"</i> they replied.</p>\n<p>Then the Buddha posed a final question:</p>\n<p><i>\"How would you measure the worth of the noble royal Khattiya race?\"</i></p>\n<p><i>\"Its value is beyond measure,\"</i> came the unanimous response.</p>\n<p>The Buddha then spoke words that would forever be remembered:</p>\n<p><i>\"For a mere stream of water, which holds little value, would you destroy the priceless noble race of Khattiya? There is no true gain in conflict\u2014only loss, suffering, and ruin.\"</i></p>\n<p>To deepen their understanding, the Blessed One recounted past J\u0101taka tales, illustrating the grave dangers of enmity and the karmic consequences of hatred. As his words sank into their hearts, both sides abandoned their hostility and embraced reconciliation.</p>\n<h3>A Legacy of Peace: The Offering of Five Hundred Princes</h3>\n<p>Out of gratitude for the Buddha\u2019s wisdom and boundless compassion, both the Sakyans and the Koliyans offered two hundred and fifty princes from each clan to become disciples of the Blessed One. These five hundred young men renounced the world, choosing the noble path of the Dhamma over the fleeting path of conflict.</p>\n<h3>The Transformation of the Five Hundred Monks</h3>\n<p>According to the commentaries, <span id=\"Endnote32\">[<a href=\"#endnote32\">32</a>]</span> after entering the monastic life, these young monks initially struggled with homesickness and longing for their former lives. Understanding their plight, the Buddha took them to the serene Ku\u1e47\u0101la Lake <span id=\"Endnote33\">[<a href=\"#endnote33\">33</a>]</span> and taught them the <i>Ku\u1e47\u0101la J\u0101taka</i>, a discourse revealing the fleeting and deceptive nature of worldly attachments.</p>\n<p>As they listened with deep reflection, the five hundred monks attained <i>sot\u0101patti</i> (stream-entry), securing their path toward liberation. Not long after, through diligent practice under the guidance of the Blessed One, they realized the highest goal\u2014<i>arahatta</i> (full awakening), completely freeing their minds from all defilements.</p>\n<p>Thus, what began as a conflict fuelled by pride and greed was transformed into an opportunity for spiritual awakening, all through the wisdom and compassion of the Buddha</p>\n<p>After renouncing the household life, the five hundred princes who had become monks under the guidance of the Buddha remained steadfast in their new path. When their wives sent messages, pleading for their return, the monks responded with unwavering resolve:</p>\n<p><i>\"We have now entered a life beyond worldly ties. The household life is no longer our home.\"</i></p>\n<p>Undeterred, the women sought the help of Mah\u0101paj\u0101pat\u012b Gotam\u012b, the Buddha\u2019s stepmother and a revered figure among them. They approached her with deep longing and respect, urging her to request the Buddha to grant them the opportunity to go forth into the monastic life.</p>\n<p>Moved by their sincerity, Mah\u0101paj\u0101pat\u012b gathered the women under her care and approached the Blessed One with a heartfelt plea. This event, described in the texts, marked a pivotal moment in history\u2014the beginning of the Bhikkhun\u012b Sangha, the Order of Nuns, which would offer women the same path to liberation as their male counterparts. In section:15-1 describes the going forth of Mah\u0101paj\u0101pat\u012b and the five hundred women.</p>\n<p>The Buddha\u2019s First Visit to Ves\u0101l\u012b \u2013 The Sixth Walking Tour</p>\n<p>During this period, another remarkable event unfolded. The great city of Ves\u0101l\u012b was suffering from three devastating calamities\u2014famine, disease, and disturbances from non-human beings. <span id=\"Endnote34\">[<a href=\"#endnote34\">34</a>]</span> Seeking refuge, the noble Licchavi princes of Ves\u0101l\u012b sent an earnest invitation to the Buddha, imploring him to come and restore peace and harmony to their land.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page14_3/image5.png\" />\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>Map showing the locations of R\u0101jagaha and Ves\u0101li </b><span id=\"Endnote35\">[<a href=\"#endnote35\">35</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Blessed One, with boundless compassion, accepted their invitation. This sacred journey, which we refer to as the <i>Sixth Walking Tour</i>, was an extraordinary testament to the Buddha\u2019s tireless dedication to the welfare of all beings. Setting out from R\u0101jagaha with sangaha, he walked to P\u0101talig\u0101ma (<i>modern-day Patna</i>), a distance of approximately 103 kilometres. There, King Bimbis\u0101ra, a devoted supporter of the Dhamma, arranged for the Buddha and the Sangha to cross the sacred waters of the Ganges on his royal barge. Having reached the northern bank, the Blessed One and the sangha continued their journey on foot, accompanied by the Licchavi princes, traveling another 35 kilometres to reach the city of Ves\u0101l\u012b. The arrival of the Blessed One in Ves\u0101l\u012b. marked the beginning of a profound transformation, as the power of his presence and teachings would soon dispel the suffering of the people and restore harmony to the land.

At that time, the city was afflicted by a devastating epidemic, and as the Buddha and the Sa\u1e45gha arrived, the Devas caused a heavy downpour to cleanse the city of the many dead bodies.</p>\n<p>Once the city was purified, the Blessed One entrusted the recitation of the <i>Ratana Sutta</i>\u2014the discourse on the Three Jewels<span id=\"Endnote38\">[<a href=\"#endnote38\">38</a>]</span> \u2014to Venerable \u0100nanda. Following the Buddha\u2019s instructions, Venerable \u0100nanda, accompanied by monks and the citizens of Ves\u0101l\u012b, circumambulated the city while sprinkling water blessed by the Buddha. As a result, all malevolent spirits were dispelled, and the entire city was safeguarded by the powerful invocation of the highest virtues of the Triple Gem\u2014Buddha, Dhamma, and Sa\u1e45gha.</p>\n<p><b>Whatever beings have gathered here,</b></p>\n<p><b>whether of the earth or in the firmament,</b></p>\n<p><b>may the minds of all be filled with joy,</b></p>\n<p><b>and may they listen attentively to these words.</b></p>\n<p><b>Therefore, all beings, be heedful and kind,</b></p>\n<p><b>be friendly to this generation of men.</b></p>\n<p><b>They who bring offerings by day and by night,</b></p>\n<p><b>as they are devoted, so should you protect them.</b></p>\n<p>At that moment, a great assembly of Devas manifested in the sky, offering homage to the Blessed One. Among them, Sakka, the lord of the Devas, is said to have recited the final three stanzas of the <i>Ratana Sutta</i>:</p>\n<p>Thus, through the supreme power of the Buddha\u2019s discourse and the devotion of the people, Ves\u0101l\u012b was liberated from its suffering, and harmony was restored.</p>\n<h3>Leaving Ves\u0101l\u012b and Arriving at R\u0101jagaha</h3>\n<p>The Blessed One remained in the city of Ves\u0101l\u012b for two weeks before setting out on his return journey to R\u0101jagaha. The Licchavi princes, filled with reverence and devotion, accompanied the Buddha as he travelled to the northern bank of the River Ganges. The journey to the riverbank took three days. <span id=\"Endnote39\">[<a href=\"#endnote39\">39</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>On the other side of the river, King Bimbis\u0101ra, the devoted patron of the Buddha, awaited his arrival with a royal barge. With great honour, the king personally ferried the Blessed One across the Ganges and led him and the Sa\u1e45gha back to R\u0101jagaha. The entire journey spanned five days.</p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page14_3/image8.jpeg\" />\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>Venerable \u00c3nanda spinking blessed water from the bowl of the Buddha at Vesali </b><span id=\"Endnote40\">[<a href=\"#endnote40\">40</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>The Ordination of Venerable Uggasena</h2>\n<p>The story of Venerable Uggasena is a well-known account from the time when the Buddha was residing in R\u0101jagaha. <span id=\"Endnote41\">[<a href=\"#endnote41\">41</a>]</span>  It carries a profound Dhamma teaching, illustrating the transient nature of worldly pleasures and the power of wisdom in overcoming attachment.</p>\n<p>During a festival season, a traveling troupe of acrobats arrived in R\u0101jagaha to entertain the king and the townspeople. Among the performers was the troupe leader\u2019s daughter, a woman of extraordinary beauty and grace. A young man named Uggasena, the son of a wealthy family, was captivated by her charm and enchanting dance. Overcome by desire, he resolved to make her his wife and implored his parents to arrange the marriage.</p>\n<p>As expected, his parents disapproved of his request. But Uggasena, consumed by passion, refused to eat, threatening to waste away in despair. Fearing for their son\u2019s life, his parents reluctantly sent a messenger to the girl\u2019s father, offering a substantial sum of money in exchange for her hand. However, the proud acrobat rejected the proposal, declaring that if the young man wished to marry his daughter, he must first prove himself by joining the troupe and mastering their craft.</p>\n<p>Blinded by desire, Uggasena abandoned his privileged life, forsaking his loving parents, wealth, and social status, to follow the acrobats. Having no prior training, he was assigned menial tasks, serving as a caretaker and assistant. Eventually, moved by Uggasena\u2019s unwavering devotion, the troupe leader consented to the marriage.</p>\n<p>However, married life did not unfold as Uggasena had imagined. His wife frequently belittled him for his lowly status within the troupe, wounding him with harsh words. Determined to earn her respect, Uggasena pleaded with his father-in-law to train him as an acrobat. Over time, he became a master performer, capable of astounding feats, including balancing atop a towering bamboo pole.</p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page14_3/image9.png\" />\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>Uggasena\u2019s acrobatic display in R\u0101jagaha </b><span id=\"Endnote42\">[<a href=\"#endnote42\">42</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>One day, eager to reclaim his dignity, Uggasena returned to R\u0101jagaha to showcase his skills. As he prepared for his performance, the Blessed One, with his boundless compassion, surveyed the world and perceived that Uggasena had the potential to transcend sa\u1e43s\u0101ra. Thus, the Buddha, accompanied by the Sa\u1e45gha, made his way to the performance site.</p>\n<p>The moment the Buddha appeared, the crowd\u2019s attention shifted toward him, leaving Uggasena\u2019s spectacle unnoticed. Witnessing this, Uggasena became disenchanted with his own abilities, realizing the emptiness of worldly pursuits. Sensing his moment of insight, the Blessed One spoke these profound words:</p>\n<p><b>\"Let go of the past, let go of the future, let go of the present. Having gone beyond rebirth, with your heart freed in every respect, you will no longer return to birth and old age.\" </b><span id=\"Endnote43\">[<a href=\"#endnote43\">43</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>Mu\u00f1ca pure mu\u00f1ca pacchato- Majjhe mu\u00f1ca bhavassa p\u0101ragu</p>\n<p>Sabbattavimuttam\u0101naso- Na puna\u1e43 j\u0101tijara\u1e43 upehisi.</i></p>\n<p>At that very moment, standing atop the bamboo pole, Uggasena attained full enlightenment, realizing the noble state of Arahantship. Descending from the pole, he approached the Buddha with deep reverence and paid homage. Seeing his spiritual readiness, the Buddha simply uttered, <b>\"Come, Bhikkhu.\"</b> With that, Uggasena was instantly ordained, becoming a noble disciple of the Blessed One.</p>\n<h3>Concluding Reflections</h3>\n<p>The inspiring journey of Bhikkhu Uggasena reminds us of the fleeting nature of worldly attachments and the limitless potential for liberation through wisdom. No matter how deeply one is entangled in desire, the Dhamma provides a path to freedom.</p>\n<p>In the next section (15-1), we will explore the Buddha\u2019s return to the city of Ves\u0101l\u012b, where he spent his fifth rainy season retreat.

This section focuses on the Blessed One\u2019s fifth rainy season, which he spent among the Licchavis in Ves\u0101l\u012b, in the Vajjian country. At this time, the Buddha was still relatively young\u2014just thirty-nine years old. Since he attained enlightenment at the age of thirty-five and had already spent four rainy seasons (ages 35\u201338), we can deduce that he was thirty-nine years old while residing in Ves\u0101l\u012b.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page15_1/image1.png\" />\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>Map showing the location of Vesali the capital of Vajji Country during the time of the Buddha </b><span id=\"Endnote2\">[<a href=\"#endnote2\">2</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Invitation by the Licchivi Princes of Ves\u0101l\u020b </h2>\n<p>We saw in Section 14-3 that, at the invitation of the Licchavi princes of Ves\u0101l\u012b, the Buddha arrived in Ves\u0101l\u012b with a large number of Sangha members and delivered the Ratana Sutta. Through the power of chanting the Ratana Sutta, the great dangers that plagued the city disappeared, and prosperity returned to Ves\u0101l\u012b. Grateful for the Buddha's visit and support, the Licchavi princes, rulers of Ves\u0101l\u012b, invited the Blessed One to spend the next rainy season there with his Sangha. They donated the Great Wood (Mah\u0101vana) and the Peak-roofed Hall (K\u016b\u1e6d\u0101g\u0101ras\u0101l\u0101) to the Buddha and the Sangha as a residence for the rainy season. This became another renowned monastery offered to the Buddha and the Sangha, following the donations of Veluvana and Jetavana monasteries.</p>\n<p>Vinaya Pitaka describes this event:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cWhen the Buddha had stayed at R\u0101jagaha for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Ves\u0101l\u012b\u2026 The Buddha eventually arrived at Ves\u0101l\u012b where he stayed in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood\u201d </i><span id=\"Endnote3\">[<a href=\"#endnote3\">3</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The following sources also confirm that the Buddha spent his fifth Vassa in Ves\u0101l\u012b</p>\n<p>1) The fifth was in the Gabled House Hall in the Great Wood relying on Ves\u0101l\u012b <span id=\"Endnote4\">[<a href=\"#endnote4\">4</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>( pa\u00f1cama\u1e41 Ves\u0101li\u1e41 upaniss\u0101ya Mah\u0101vane K\u016b\u1e6d\u0101g\u0101ras\u0101l\u0101ya\u1e41)</p>\n<p></i></p>\n<p>2) The Sage-Lion of the Sakyas, in the fifth Rains Retreat, has dwelt in the Great Wood, which was near to the very delightful city known by the name of Ves\u0101l\u012b, which was resplendent with the rays of the crown-jewels of (many) Princes <span id=\"Endnote5\">[<a href=\"#endnote5\">5</a>]</span>.</p>\n<p>(Sakya-Muni-Kesar\u012b, pa\u00f1camamhi Vassamhi, Bh\u016b-p\u0101la-mo\u1e37i-ma\u1e47i-ra\u1e41si-vir\u0101jam\u0101na\u1e41 su-ramma\u1e41 nagara\u1e41 Ves\u0101li-n\u0101ma-vidita\u1e41 niss\u0101ya Mah\u0101-Vanasmi\u1e41 v\u0101sa\u1e41 akarittha)</p>\n<p>3) \u201c The Buddha took up residence at Kutagara monastery, which had terraced roofing and crowning pinnacle, in the country of Ves\u0101l\u012b to observe the fifth vassa <span id=\"Endnote6\">[<a href=\"#endnote6\">6</a>]</span>.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page15_1/image2.png\" />\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>Ruins of the Peak Hall of Vesali: The Ananda stupa with the Lion Piller built by King Asoka in the background </b><span id=\"Endnote7\">[<a href=\"#endnote7\">7</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page15_1/image3.png\" />\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>Ruins of Kutagarasala Vihara in Vesali </b><span id=\"Endnote8\">[<a href=\"#endnote8\">8</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>Some of the significant events happened in Ves\u0101l\u012b during the fifth rainy season</h1>\n<h2>Visit of J\u012bvaka Kom\u0101rabhacca</h2>\n<h3>Building of Walking Paths and Saunas</h3>\n<p>He was the adopted son of Prince Abaya, one of King Bimbisara's sons, and was appointed by the king as the Physician of the Buddha and the Sangha. One day, while the Blessed One was spending the rainy season in the Great Wood, J\u012bvaka Kom\u0101rabhacca arrived there on some business. Seeing that a group of monks appeared unwell, he immediately approached the Buddha and said:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cAt present, Sir, there are monks who are often sick, their bodies being full of impurities. Please allow walking meditation paths and saunas. In this way the monks will rarely get sick\u201d </i><span id=\"Endnote9\">[<a href=\"#endnote9\">9</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>After teaching J\u012bvaka, the Buddha addressed the monks, granting them permission to build walking paths and saunas and instructing them to use them appropriately.</p>\n<h2>Passing-away of King Suddhodana</h2>\n<p>We could not find any records in the scriptures confirming King Suddhodana's passing-away as an Arahant. However, the following sources describe the event as follows:</p>\n<p>1)  \u201c<i>When the Buddha was observing the fifth vassa in Mah\u0101vana forest near Ves\u0101l\u012b, King Suddhodana entered Nibb\u0101na after attaining under the white umbrella in his golden palace. \u201d </i><span id=\"Endnote10\">[<a href=\"#endnote10\">10</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2) \u201c<i>At that time, (when the Buddha was residing in Ves\u0101l\u020b), one day, the Buddha, who was looking at the world, saw that the king (his father) was suffering from an illness and that he was eager to see him, and he went there with a group of disciples. There, the king was lying down, and the Blessed One, who was sitting on a cushioned seat, placed his right hand on the king's cheek and, by the power of true action, removed the pain. Then the great arahant Nanda took the king's right hand and performed true action. At that very moment, the fever in that hand also disappeared. The venerable Ananda placed his hands on the king's left hand, the venerable Sariputta on his back, and the venerable Mugalana on both sides and performed true action. At that moment, all the fever in the king's body disappeared completely. Thus, the king was cured of his illness. But he was very old and weak in body.</i></p>\n<p><i>On this occasion the Blessed One admonished the king with a discourse on impermanence. In the midst of the discourse, the king attained arahantship. \u201d</i><span id=\"Endnote11\">[<a href=\"#endnote11\">11</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>3) The commentator of Therigata, Venerable Dhammap\u0101la says, on a later occasion, when the Teacher was living in the K\u016b\u1e6d\u0101g\u0101ra Hall near Ves\u0101l\u012b, the great King Suddhodana attained final quenching [nibb\u0101na], having realized arahantship <span id=\"Endnote12\">[<a href=\"#endnote12\">12</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Founding of the Bhikkhuni Sangha</h2>\n<p>Another significant and remarkable event during this time was the founding of the Bhikkhuni Sangha. Until then, the Buddha had only the Bhikkhu Sangha, along with laymen and laywomen followers. The establishment of the Bhikkhuni Sangha fulfilled the Buddha\u2019s aspiration to create a \u2018<b>Fourfold Assembly\u2019</b> for the flourishing of his dispensation (as briefly mentioned in Section 4-1).</p>\n<p>Vinaya Pitaka elaborates this event thus: <span id=\"Endnote13\">[<a href=\"#endnote13\">13</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\u201cAt one time the Buddha was staying in the Sakyan country in the Banyan Tree Monastery at Kapilavatthu. At this time Mah\u0101paj\u0101pati Gotam\u012b went to the Buddha, bowed down to him, and said, \u201cSir, please allow women to go forth into homelessness on the spiritual path proclaimed by the Buddha.\u201d</i></p>\n<p><i>\u201cLet it be, Gotami, don\u2019t pursue this idea.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>On that occasion the Buddha was not inclined to grant her request.</p>\n<p>We assumed that Mah\u0101paj\u0101pati Gotam\u012b\u2019s request to go forth was made after the passing-away of King Suddhodana. According to tradition, during that time, the Buddha was in Kapilavattu, attending to his ailing father and, after his death, overseeing his funeral and the cremation of his body. In Section 14-1, we saw that during his first visit to Kapilavatthu, the Buddha preached the Dhamma to his father and foster mother, Mah\u0101paj\u0101pati Gotam\u012b, establishing both of them in stream-entry.</p>\n<p>We believe that Queen Gotam\u012b\u2019s requests to renounce lay life after her husband\u2019s passing -away was not unusual for a noblewoman like her\u2014by that time, she was already a stream-winner. Reflecting on her background, she had lovingly raised children who later embraced the spiritual path: Prince Siddhartha became the Buddha, Prince Nanda and Princess Nand\u0101 joined the monastic order, and her beloved grandson, Prince R\u0101hula, also entered the noble Sa\u1e45gha. Likewise, many of her close relatives, including the Sakyan princes \u0100nanda, Anuruddha, and Bhaddiya, had become the Buddha\u2019s disciples. In this light, Queen Gotam\u012b\u2019s requests to go forth seems almost inevitable.</p>\n<h3>The Historic Ordination of Mah\u0101paj\u0101pati Gotam\u012b: A Pivotal Moment in the Buddha\u2019s Dispensation</h3>\n<p>The <i>Vinaya Pi\u1e6daka</i> describes Mah\u0101paj\u0101pati Gotam\u012b\u2019s ordination as follows:  <span id=\"Endnote14\">[<a href=\"#endnote14\">14</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>After staying in Kapilavattu for as long as he wished, the Buddha set out on his journey to Ves\u0101l\u012b. Upon his arrival, he resided in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood. Meanwhile, Mah\u0101paj\u0101pati shaved her hair, donned ochre robes, and, accompanied by a group of Sakyan women, set out for Ves\u0101l\u012b. When she finally arrived, she stood outside the gatehouse\u2014sorrowful and tearful, covered in dust, with swollen feet.</p>\n<p>The Venerable \u0100nanda saw her standing there in such a condition and said to her:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cGotam\u012b, why are you standing outside the entrance with your feet swollen and your body covered with dust, miserable and saddened, weeping with a tearful face?\u201d</i></p>\n<p><i>\u201cI do so, Bhante \u0100nanda, because the Blessed One does not allow the going forth of women from the household life into homelessness.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>Venerable \u0100nanda comforted her, spoke to her with compassion, and then approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and asked:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cBhante, Mah\u0101paj\u0101pat\u012b Gotam\u012b is standing outside the entrance \u2026miserable and saddened, weeping with a tearful face, because the Blessed One does not allow the going forth of women. Bhante, it would be good if women could obtain the going forth\u2026\u201d</i></p>\n<p>The Buddha said:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cEnough, \u0100nanda! Do not favour the going forth of women from the household life into homelessness in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tath\u0101gata.\u201d </i><span id=\"Endnote15\">[<a href=\"#endnote15\">15</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>After the refusal of the Buddha on that matter Venerable \u0100nanda thought for a while and asked this way:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cBhante, if a woman were to go forth from the household life into homelessness in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tath\u0101gata, would it be possible for her to realize the fruit of stream-entry, the fruit of once-returning, the fruit of non-returning, and the fruit of arahantship?</i></p>\n<p><i>\u201cIt would be, \u0100nanda\u201d</i></p>\n<p><i>\u201cIf, Bhante, it would be possible for a woman to realize the fruit of stream-entry\u2026 the fruit of arahantship, and considering that Mah\u0101paj\u0101pat\u012b Gotam\u012b had been very helpful to the</i></p>\n<p><i>Blessed One\u2014having been his maternal aunt, wet-nurse, and foster mother who nurtured him with breast milk when his mother died\u2014it would be good if women could obtain the going forth\u2026 in the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tath\u0101gata.\u201d.</i></p>\n<p>Then the Buddha said: <i>\u201c\u2026 if Mah\u0101paj\u0101pat\u012b Gotam\u012b accepts eight principles of respect, let that itself be her full ordination.\u201d</i><span id=\"Endnote16\">[<a href=\"#endnote16\">16</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Right then, Venerable \u0100nanda joyfully shared the good news with Mah\u0101paj\u0101pati Gotam\u012b. Filled with gratitude, she wholeheartedly accepted it, <b>becoming the first Bhikkhun\u012b to be ordained under the Buddha.</b></p>\n<p>In later occasion The Buddha confirmed her ordination thus:<span id=\"Endnote17\">[<a href=\"#endnote17\">17</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\u201cMah\u0101paj\u0101pati was ordained from the moment she accepted the eight important principles\u201d.</i></p>\n<h4><i>Five Hundred Sakyan Women\u2019s Going Forth</i></h4>\n<p>After her ordination she approached the Blessed One paid homage and asked:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cSir, what should I do with these Sakyan women?</i>\u201d The Buddha then instructed\u2026 and gladdened her with a teaching, after which she bowed down, circumambulated him with her right side toward him, and left. Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a Teaching and</p>\n<p>addressed the monks:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cI allow monks to give the full ordination to nuns.\u201d</i><span id=\"Endnote18\">[<a href=\"#endnote18\">18</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Afterward, the Sakyan women who had accompanied Venerable Mah\u0101paj\u0101pati Gotam\u012b from Kapilavattu to Ves\u0101l\u012b were ordained by the monks. It is said that sometime after this event, two devas appeared before the Buddha and spoke of the liberation of the Bhikkhun\u012bs. According to the commentary, these were the five hundred Sakyan women who had followed Mah\u0101paj\u0101pati Gotam\u012b and were ordained by the monks in Ves\u0101l\u012b. <span id=\"Endnote19\">[<a href=\"#endnote19\">19</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page15_1/image4.png\" />\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>Mah\u0101paj\u0101pati Gotam\u012b and Five Hundred Sakyan Women: A Courageous Journey from Kapilavattu in Pursuit of the Holy Life </b><span id=\"Endnote20\">[<a href=\"#endnote20\">20</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>How to recognize the Dhamma and the Discipline of Tath\u0101gata</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>After her ordination, the Buddha delivered a profound discourse to Venerable Bhikkhuni Mah\u0101paj\u0101pati Gotam\u012b at the Great Wood Monastery in Ves\u0101l\u012b. He declared that any spiritual path leading to non-attachment, detachment, simplicity, fewness of desires, contentment, solitude, diligence, and being easy to support can be recognized as the true Dhamma. With these guiding principles, the Blessed One illuminated the essence of the noble path, inspiring all seekers to walk in the footsteps of wisdom and liberation. <span id=\"Endnote21\">[<a href=\"#endnote21\">21</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Other Important Teachings Given in Ves\u0101l\u012b </h2>\n<p>According to the scriptures, the Buddha delivered many sermons in Ves\u0101l\u012b. However, he spent only two rainy seasons there\u2014the fifth and his final one, the 45th <i>vassa</i>. The <i>Sutta Pi\u1e6daka</i> also mentions that he visited Ves\u0101l\u012b and the Vajji country frequently during his walking tours, making it difficult to determine with certainty which suttas were delivered during these periods. Therefore, by carefully comparing the scriptures with other sources, we have selected the following Dhamma talks and concluded that they were most likely given during the Buddha\u2019s fifth rainy season in Ves\u0101l\u012b.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Discourses given to Saccaka the Niga\u1e47\u1e6dha\u2019s son <span id=\"Endnote22\">[<a href=\"#endnote22\">22</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>According to the scriptures, the following two suttas were delivered during this period: the <i>C\u016b\u1e37asaccaka Sutta</i> (MN:35) and the <i>Mah\u0101saccaka Sutta</i> (MN:36).</p>\n<p>In the <i>C\u016b\u1e37asaccaka Sutta</i>, the Buddha engaged in an in-depth discussion with Saccaka, a well-known debater, on the doctrine of not-self (<i>anatt\u0101</i>). The Blessed One explained the nature of the self-according to his teachings and elaborated on how he trains and instructs his disciples. The discourse showcases the Buddha\u2019s skill in debate and his ability to dismantle Saccaka\u2019s misconceptions through reason and logic.</p>\n<p>In the <i>Mah\u0101saccaka Sutta</i>, the Buddha delivered a discourse on the development of the body and mind. He described his own journey to enlightenment, including the various extreme ascetic practices he undertook before discovering the Middle Path. He emphasized the importance of mental cultivation and meditation in attaining true wisdom and liberation.</p>\n<p>At the conclusion of these two suttas, Saccaka expressed deep admiration and respect for the Buddha\u2019s wisdom. However, despite his appreciation, he neither became a lay follower nor sought ordination. According to the commentary, after his passing-away, he was reborn in Sri Lanka, where he eventually became an arahant known as K\u0101la Buddharakkhita Thera. <span id=\"Endnote23\">[<a href=\"#endnote23\">23</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>A straightforward approach to completing the training</h3>\n<p>On one occasion, a young Vajji monk approached the Buddha and expressed that, due to the numerous training rules being introduced over time, he was struggling to focus on all of them. The Blessed One then asked:</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Can you train in the three trainings, bhikkhu: the training in the higher virtuous behaviour, the training in the higher mind, and the training in the higher wisdom?\u201d</i></p>\n<p><i>\u201cI can, Bhante.\u201d</i></p>\n<p><i>\u201cTherefore, bhikkhu, train in the three trainings: the training in the higher virtuous behaviour, the training in the higher mind, and the training in the higher wisdom. As you train in them, you will abandon lust, hatred, and delusion. With the abandoning of lust, hatred, and delusion, you will do nothing unwholesome or resort to anything bad.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>The monk gladly accepted the Buddha\u2019s advice, followed it diligently, and was freed from all suffering. <span id=\"Endnote24\">[<a href=\"#endnote24\">24</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>The Blessed One is perfectly enlightened! The Dhamma is well expounded, and the Sa\u1e45gha is following the noble path.</h3>\n<p>The Buddha made this declaration to a large gathering of Bhikkhus at the Gotamaka Shrine in Ves\u0101l\u012b. According to the scriptures, these were the same Bhikkhus who, on a previous occasion, had listened to the <i>M\u016blapariy\u0101ya Sutta</i> (MN:1) but had not been pleased with the Buddha\u2019s words. On this occasion, the Buddha offered them this brief teaching . <span id=\"Endnote25\">[<a href=\"#endnote25\">25</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201c<i>The Buddha teaches Dhamma through direct knowledge; teaches the Dhamma with a basis and teaches Dhamma with remedies. Therefore, the Buddha\u2019s teachings should be followed accordingly.</i>\u201d The Bhikkhus\u2019 were elated in the Blessed One\u2019s statement. <span id=\"Endnote26\">[<a href=\"#endnote26\">26</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>What are the Five Rare Gems in this World?</h3>\n<p>On one occasion, five hundred Licchavis visited the Buddha at the Great Wood monastery. The Buddha inspired them with the following Dhamma talk:</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Licchavis, the manifestation of five gems is rare in the world\u201d</i></p>\n<p>What five? (1) The manifestation of a Tath\u0101gata. (2) A person who can teach the Dhamma taught by the Buddha. (3) A person who can understand the Teachings\u2014Dhamma. (4) A person who is able to train according to teachings.  (5) A grateful and thankful person. <span id=\"Endnote27\">[<a href=\"#endnote27\">27</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>It is important to recognize for oneself what is wholesome and what is unwholesome.</h3>\n<p>On one occasion, the Blessed One was residing at Ves\u0101l\u012b in the Great Wood when Bhaddiya the Licchavi approached him, paid homage, and asked:</p>\n<p><i>Bhante, I have heard this: \u2018The ascetic Gotama is a magician who knows a converting magic by which he converts the disciples of teachers of other sects\u2026\u201d. </i></p>\n<p>Bhaddiya sought to understand whether the statement was true. In response, the Buddha said:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cCome, Bhaddiya, do not go by oral tradition, by lineage of teaching, by hearsay, by scriptures, by logical reasoning\u2026 competence of a speaker\u2026or because the person is your teacher\u2026 But when you know for yourself: \u2018These things are unwholesome; these things are blameworthy; these things are censured by the wise; these things, if accepted and undertaken, lead to harm and suffering, then you should abandon them.\u201d</i><span id=\"Endnote28\">[<a href=\"#endnote28\">28</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Buddha then gave a detailed discourse on the factors that lead to unwholesome actions and how abandoning them can bring long-lasting peace and happiness. At the end of the teaching, Bhaddiya became a lay follower of the Buddha. <span id=\"Endnote29\">[<a href=\"#endnote29\">29</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3> Crossing of the Flood</h3>\n<p>While staying in the Great Wood in Ves\u0101l\u012b, the Buddha gave an extensive Dhamma teaching to the two Licchavi princesses, S\u0101\u1e37ha and Abhya.<span id=\"Endnote30\">[<a href=\"#endnote30\">30</a>]</span> They inquired about a teaching proclaimed by some other ascetics, which suggested that by practicing virtue and severe austerities (<i>s\u012blavisuddhi</i> and <i>tapojigucch\u0101</i>), one could cross the flood\u2014meaning to go beyond <i>sa\u1e43s\u0101ra</i> or eradicate all defilements.</p>\n<p>In his response, the Buddha acknowledged the purification of virtuous behaviour as one of the factors of asceticism (<i>s\u0101ma\u00f1\u00f1a\u1e45ga</i>), but he rejected the practice of austerities. The Buddha said:</p>\n<p><i>\u201c\u2026those ascetics and brahmins whose bodily, verbal, and mental behaviours are impure, and whose livelihood is impure, are incapable of knowledge and vision, of unsurpassed enlightenment\u2026</i> <i>those ascetics and brahmins whose bodily, verbal, and mental behaviour are pure, and whose livelihood is pure, are capable of knowledge and vision, of unsurpassed enlightenment.\u201d</i><span id=\"Endnote31\">[<a href=\"#endnote31\">31</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Therefore, a person who possesses moral purity through body, speech, and mind, along with right sam\u0101dhi and right view, will ultimately attain liberation.</p>\n<h3>Factors beneficial to a leader in a community</h3>\n<p>While staying in the Great Wood of Ves\u0101l\u012b, the Blessed One taught the five principles that support a leader or ruler in developing their leadership skills. This discourse was delivered to Mah\u0101n\u0101ma Licchavi.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1)\tVeneration and care for one\u2019s parents</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2)\tCare for one\u2019s wife, family, and workers</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>3)\tRespect for neighbours and business associates</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>4)\tWorship of the protective deities honoured by family tradition</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>5)\tReverence for good ascetics and brahmins</p>\n<p>By adhering to these five principles, a leader ensures the well-being and prosperity of their family, workers, associates, and deities, who, in turn, wish them welfare and success.</p>\n<p>The Blessed One further said:</p>\n<p><i>\u201c Having done what is good,</i></p>\n<p><i>he is worthy of veneration and praise.</i></p>\n<p><i>They praise him here in this world</i></p>\n<p><i>and after death he rejoices in heaven.\u201d  </i><span id=\"Endnote32\">[<a href=\"#endnote32\">32</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Seven Principles of Non-decline <span id=\"Endnote33\">[<a href=\"#endnote33\">33</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The following discourse was given by the Buddha while he was staying at the Saranda Shrine in Ves\u0101l\u012b, addressed to the Licchavi princes. This teaching focused on the qualities to be developed by leaders of a community:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1)\tRegularly assembling together</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2)\tConducting affairs in harmony and adjourning in harmony</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>3)\tNot introducing new rules or abolishing existing ones without cause</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>4)\tRespecting and caring for the elders of the community</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>5)\tRefraining from capturing women and girls and forcing them to live with them</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>6)\tContinuing to venerate and respect their traditional shrines</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>7)\tProviding righteous protection and shelter for arahants</p>\n<p>As long as the Vajjis uphold these seven principles, they will not experience decline. <span id=\"Endnote34\">[<a href=\"#endnote34\">34</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Guidance to Sick Sangha</h3>\n<p>The following Dhamma guidance were given by the Buddha to a sick bhikkhu, while he was dwelling in Great Wodd in Ves\u0101l\u012b:</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Bhikkhus, if five things do not slip away from a frail and sick bhikkhu, it can be expected of him: to reach final knowledge\u2026\u201d</i></p>\n<p>What are the five? 1) contemplating the unattractiveness of the body 2) perceiving the repulsiveness of food, 3) perceiving non-delight in the entire the entire world 4) contemplating impermanence in all things 5) contemplation of perception of death. <span id=\"Endnote35\">[<a href=\"#endnote35\">35</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Benefits of the Generosity</h3>\n<h4><i>To Siha</i></h4>\n<p>One day, while the Buddha was staying at the Great Wood in Ves\u0101l\u012b, General S\u012bha approached him, paid homage, and asked whether it was possible to identify a directly visible result of generosity. In response, the Buddha contrasted the outcomes of a miser and a generous giver, saying:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cWith the breakup of the body, after death, a donor, a generous giver, is reborn in a good</i></p>\n<p><i>destination, in a heavenly world.\u201d</i><span id=\"Endnote36\">[<a href=\"#endnote36\">36</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h4><i>To Ugga</i></h4>\n<p>The following sutta also emphasizes the importance of giving.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>On one occasion, Ugga, a lay follower of the Buddha, offered all that agreeable to him to the Blessed One and the Sangha at his residence. After the meal at Ugga\u2019s house, the Buddha expressed his appreciation for the offerings, saying:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cThe giver of the agreeable gains the agreeable,</i></p>\n<p><i>when he gives willingly to the upright ones</i></p>\n<p><i>clothing, bedding, food, and drink,</i></p>\n<p><i>and various kinds of requisites.</i></p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Having known the arahants to be like a field</i></p>\n<p><i>for what is relinquished and offered, not held back,</i></p>\n<p><i>the good person gives what is hard to give:</i></p>\n<p><i>the giver of agreeable things gains what is agreeable.\u201d</i><span id=\"Endnote37\">[<a href=\"#endnote37\">37</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Many laypeople from Ves\u0101l\u012b became followers of the Buddha.</h2>\n<p>According to the scriptures, while the Buddha was residing in Ves\u0101l\u012b, leaders of other sects attempted to prevent their followers from coming under the Buddha\u2019s influence. However, those with wisdom, after hearing the Buddha's teachings, chose to follow him. Some of these individuals became great practitioners and reached noble states of realization. Among them, we have selected a few to illustrate how they developed in the Dhamma.</p>\n<h3>Ugga the householder from Ves\u0101l\u012b</h3>\n<p>He was a householder from Ves\u0101l\u012b. Upon seeing the Blessed One for the first time, his mind was filled with confidence in the Buddha. There and then, he bowed down and became a lay follower. He recounted the meeting as follows:</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>When, Bhante, I first saw the Blessed One in the distance, as soon as I saw him my mind acquired confidence in him\u2026with a confident mind, I attended on the Blessed One. The Blessed One then gave me a progressive discourse\u2026when the Blessed One knew that my mind was pliant, softened, rid of hindrances, uplifted, and confident, he revealed that Dhamma teaching special to the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the</i></p>\n<p><i>path. Then, just as a clean cloth rid of dark spots would readily absorb dye, so too, while I sat in that same seat, the dust free, stainless Dhamma-eye arose in me\u201d </i><span id=\"Endnote38\">[<a href=\"#endnote38\">38</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>At that occasion he became a stream-winner. The Buddha declared him to be foremost among those who give what is agreeable. <span id=\"Endnote39\">[<a href=\"#endnote39\">39</a>]</span> He also acknowledged that Ugga possessed six noble qualities, had attained certainty about the Tath\u0101gata, and had become a seer of the deathless\u2014one who lives having realized the deathless. <span id=\"Endnote40\">[<a href=\"#endnote40\">40</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>On one occasion the Buddha addressed the monks and said:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cBhikkhus, you should remember the householder Ugga of Ves\u0101l\u012b as one who possesses eight astounding and amazing qualities.\u201d </i><span id=\"Endnote41\">[<a href=\"#endnote41\">41</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The scriptures say that before his death, he became a non-returner. After passing away from this world, he was reborn among a group of mind-made deities. <span id=\"Endnote42\">[<a href=\"#endnote42\">42</a>]</span> As a young deva, he came to pay homage to the Buddha. The Buddha then said:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cThe person who gives the best,</i></p>\n<p><i>the giver of the foremost,</i></p>\n<p><i>the giver of the excellent,</i></p>\n<p><i>is long-lived and famous</i></p>\n<p><i>wherever he is reborn.\u201d</i><span id=\"Endnote43\">[<a href=\"#endnote43\">43</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Brahmin Pi\u1e45giy\u0101n\u012b and Brahmin K\u0101ra\u1e47ap\u0101l\u012b</h3>\n<p>Brahmin Pi\u1e45giy\u0101n\u012b was another noble lay follower from Ves\u0101l\u012b. According to tradition, he had attained the fruit of non-returning. His daily practice was to visit the Buddha and offer him incense and garlands. <span id=\"Endnote44\">[<a href=\"#endnote44\">44</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>On one occasion he praised the Buddha in the presence of five hundred Licchavis thus:</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>As the fragrant red kokanada lotus</i></p>\n<p><i>blooms in the morning, its fragrance unspent,</i></p>\n<p><i>behold A\u1e45g\u012brasa radiant</i></p>\n<p><i>like the sun beaming in the sky.\u201d </i><span id=\"Endnote45\">[<a href=\"#endnote45\">45</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>According to the sutta, five hundred Licchavis were inspired by Brahmin Pi\u1e45giy\u0101n\u012b\u2019s faith and offered him five hundred shawls. In return, Pi\u1e45giy\u0101n\u012b offered all of them to the Buddha, his teacher. The Blessed One, appreciating both acts\u2014Brahmin Pi\u1e45giy\u0101n\u012b\u2019s gratitude towards the Buddha, as he was established in the Dhamma, and the Licchavi princes\u2019 thankfulness for Pi\u1e45giy\u0101n\u012b\u2019s words\u2014praised the spirit of gratitude shown by all. (see above: Five Rare Gems).</p>\n<p>*On one occasion, while returning from the Great Wood monastery, the Brahmin Pi\u1e45giy\u0101n\u012b met Brahmin K\u0101ra\u1e47ap\u0101l\u012b, who sought to learn more about the Buddha and asked:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cWhat do you think of the ascetic Gotama\u2019s competence in wisdom? Do you consider him wise?\u201d</i></p>\n<p>Brahmin Pi\u1e45giy\u0101n\u012b replied:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cWho am I, sir, that I could know the ascetic Gotama\u2019s competence in wisdom? Certainly, only one like him could know his competence in wisdom!\u201d</i></p>\n<p>Brahmin K\u0101ra\u1e47ap\u0101l\u012b:</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>You praise the ascetic Gotama with lofty praise, indeed.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>Brahmin Pi\u1e45giy\u0101n\u012b replied:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cWho am I, sir, that I could praise the ascetic Gotama? Praised by those who are praised, Master Gotama is best among devas and humans\u201d.</i></p>\n<p>Urged by Brahmin K\u0101ra\u1e47ap\u0101l\u012b, Pi\u1e45giy\u0101n\u012b shared his deep confidence in the Buddha with the following account: <span id=\"Endnote46\">[<a href=\"#endnote46\">46</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1)\tJust as a man who has found satisfaction in the best of tastes will no longer desire inferior flavours, so too, once one hears of Master Gotama\u2019s Dhamma, they will no longer yearn for the teachings of ordinary ascetics and brahmins.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2)\tJust as a man oppressed by hunger, who receives a honey cake, will savour the sweet, delicious taste, so too, whatever one hears of Master Gotama\u2019s Dhamma will bring satisfaction and peace of mind.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>3)\tJust as a man who encounters a piece of sandalwood will enjoy its pure, fragrant scent wherever he smells it, so too, whatever one hears of Master Gotama\u2019s Dhamma will bring elation and joy.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>4)\tJust as a capable physician might instantly cure a sick, afflicted person, whatever one hears of Master Gotama\u2019s Dhamma will cause their sorrow to vanish.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>5)\tJust as a delightful pond with cool, clear water can quench the thirst of a thirsty man who enters and drinks, so too, whatever one hears of Master Gotama\u2019s Dhamma will cause their afflictions to subside.</p>\n<p>Brahmin K\u0101ra\u1e47ap\u0101l\u012b, inspired by Pi\u1e45giy\u0101n\u012b\u2019s words, said:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cMaster Pi\u1e45giy\u0101n\u012b, I now go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the Dhamma, and to the Sa\u1e45gha of bhikkhus.

On one occasion, while sitting in the assembly hall of the Licchavis in Ves\u0101l\u012b, General S\u012bha overheard well-known Licchavis praising the Buddha, his teachings, and his disciples. Impressed by their words, he desired to meet the Buddha. He first went to his teacher, who discouraged him from doing so, and General S\u012bha abandoned the idea.</p>\n<p>On a second occasion, he again heard the Licchavis honouring the Blessed One. He went to his teacher once more, but was again discouraged. However, after hearing about the noble qualities of the Buddha for a third time, General S\u012bha decided to go see the Buddha, this time with his people in five hundred chariots, without seeking permission from his teacher.</p>\n<p>Upon meeting the Blessed One, he said: <span id=\"Endnote48\">[<a href=\"#endnote48\">48</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201c<i>I have heard this, Bhante: \u2018The ascetic Gotama is a proponent of non-doing who teaches his Dhamma for the sake of non-doing and thereby guides his disciples\u201d. </i></p>\n<p>The Buddha then gave him a detailed discourse, explaining why he was called a \"non-doer\" by other religious sects. After hearing this, General S\u012bha was overjoyed and expressed his desire to become a follower of the Buddha. The Blessed One responded:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cMake an investigation, S\u012bha! It is beneficial for well-known individuals like yourself to investigate... Your family has long supported the Niga\u1e47\u1e6dhas, so you should consider continuing to offer alms to them when they approach you.</i>\u201d</p>\n<p>General S\u012bha requested the Buddha to accept him as a lay follower. The Buddha then gave him a progressive Dhamma talk, and when he saw that S\u012bha's mind had been uplifted and his confidence strengthened, the Buddha imparted the teaching that was unique to him\u2014the Four Noble Truths. General S\u012bha understood the teaching and became a stream-winner.<span id=\"Endnote49\">[<a href=\"#endnote49\">49</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>V\u0101se\u1e6d\u1e6dha from Ves\u0101l\u012b</h3>\n<p>He met the Buddha in Ves\u0101l\u012b and became a lay follower. The Buddha declared that he possessed six qualities: 1) unwavering confidence in the Buddha, 2) unwavering confidence in the Dhamma, 3) unwavering confidence in the Sangha, 4) noble virtue, 5) noble knowledge, and 6) noble liberation. He had attained certainty about the Tath\u0101gata, becoming a seer of the deathless\u2014one who lives having realized the deathless. <span id=\"Endnote50\">[<a href=\"#endnote50\">50</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Buddha gave following advice to him:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cV\u0101se\u1e6d\u1e6dha, observed complete in eight factors, the uposatha is of great fruit and benefit, extraordinarily brilliant and pervasive\u2026\u201d</i><span id=\"Endnote51\">[<a href=\"#endnote51\">51</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>V\u0101se\u1e6d\u1e6dha then said:</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Bhante, if my beloved relatives and family members would observe the uposatha complete in eight factors, that would lead to their welfare and happiness for a long time. \u201d</i></p>\n<h3>Mah\u0101li Licchavi Prince</h3>\n<p>According to the scriptures, he became a follower of the Buddha while the Buddha was residing at the Great Wood Monastery in Ves\u0101l\u012b. <span id=\"Endnote52\">[<a href=\"#endnote52\">52</a>]</span>.  On one occasion, he approached the Buddha and asked about the causes and conditions for both bad and good kamma.</p>\n<p>The Buddha then explained five factors that lead to bad kamma:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1)\tGreed</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2)\tHate</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>3)\tDelusion</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>4)\tCareless attention</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>5)\tWrong view</p>\n<p>He then explained five factors that lead to good kamma:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1)\tNon-greed</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2)\tNon-hate</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>3)\tNon-delusion</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>4)\tCareful attention</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>5)\tRight view</p>\n<p>In conclusion, the Buddha said:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cIf, Mah\u0101li, these ten qualities did not exist in the world, unrighteous conduct, conduct contrary to the Dhamma, and righteous conduct, conduct in accordance with the Dhamma, would not be seen. But because these ten qualities exist in the world, unrighteous conduct, conduct contrary to the Dhamma, and righteous conduct, conduct in accordance with the Dhamma, are seen.\u201d</i><span id=\"Endnote53\">[<a href=\"#endnote53\">53</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Bhaddiya and Mah\u0101n\u0101ma Licchavi Princes</h3>\n<p>According to the scriptures, both princes became lay followers of the Buddha during this period, a matter already discussed under the topic \"Other Important Teachings Given in Ves\u0101l\u012b.\" It is also noteworthy that five hundred Licchavi princes respected, honoured, and followed the Buddha. An account of this is found in the C\u016b\u1e37asaccaka Sutta (MN:35).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Wanderer Vacchagotta</p>\n<p>According to the scriptures, while the Buddha was residing at the Great Wood Monastery, Wanderer Vacchagotta was also living in Ves\u0101l\u012b. The Tevijjavacchagotta Sutta (MN:71) describes his encounter with the Buddha. After a long discussion, he was delighted by the Buddha\u2019s teachings but did not immediately become a lay follower. Later, he did become a lay follower and eventually attained the noble state of an arahant disciple. <span id=\"Endnote54\">[<a href=\"#endnote54\">54</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>We will conclude this section here.

The exact location of the Chaya Forest is unknown.\u201d <span id=\"Endnote4\">[<a href=\"#endnote4\">4</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Where are the Ma\u1e45kula hills?</h2>\n<p>The Ma\u1e45kula Hills of ancient India, during the time of the Buddha, are not marked on modern Indian maps. Some researchers suggest that the ancient Ma\u1e45kula Hills are now known as the Prabhosa Hills and caves region, located in the present-day Kosambi district.  <span id=\"Endnote5\">[<a href=\"#endnote5\">5</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The following extracts provide some insight into the possible location of the Ma\u1e45kula Hills (<i>Ma\u1e45kula Pabba</i>).</p>\n<p><i>1) \u201c We read that \u0100nanda and a group of monks went from Kosamb\u012b to inspect the Pilakkha Tree Cave and while there they met a large group of wandering ascetics. This must refer to one of the caves or rock overhangs on Prabhosa Hill some eight kilometres west of Kosamb\u012b. Pabhosa may be the Ma\u1e45kula Hill where the commentaries say the Buddha spent his sixth rainy season. Archaeological evidence shows that this hill was the abode of ascetics for centuries\u201d </i><span id=\"Endnote6\">[<a href=\"#endnote6\">6</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>2)  \u201c\u2026 \u00a0Prabhosa, this hill was known in ancient times as Mankula and is where the Buddha spent his sixth rains retreat. There are no discourses in the Tipitaka taught at Prabhosa so perhaps the Buddha spent the whole stay here in silence. If so, this would be quite understandable; Prabhosa is a particularly lonely and peaceful place. The Chinese pilgrim Hiuen Tsiang came here in the 7th century and saw a stupa built by King Asoka but neither this or any other Buddhist antiquities can be found here today. There are caves and rock shelters all over Prabhosa particularly on the steeper and rockier north side. The largest cave, now called Sita\u2019s Window, may have been where the Buddha stayed during his visit. In later centuries it was the Jains who came to dominate PrabhoMapsa as is clear from their many inscriptions and images in the area. Climb to the top of the hill and you will get a sweeping view over the Yamuna River and the small temple town of Prabhosa nearby. About a kilometre from Kosambi the main road back to Allahabad branches to the left. Proceed along it for about 10 kilometres and you will come to Prabhosa\u201d </i><span id=\"Endnote7\">[<a href=\"#endnote7\">7</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page15_2/image1.png\" />\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>Present day picture of Prabhosa hills ( Mankula Hills) </b><span id=\"Endnote8\">[<a href=\"#endnote8\">8</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b> </b></p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page15_2/image2.png\" />\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>Map showing the present-day location of Prabhosa hills (ancient Mankula Hiils) in Kosambi District of UP, India </b><span id=\"Endnote9\">[<a href=\"#endnote9\">9</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page15_2/image3.png\" />\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>Google Map showing the location of Pabbhosa in Kaushambi region </b><span id=\"Endnote10\">[<a href=\"#endnote10\">10</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Teachings Given at Mount Ma\u1e45kula</h2>\n<p>While the Blessed One delivered many discourses during his time in Kosambi, the scriptures do not mention any significant Dhamma teachings specifically during the sixth rainy season, when he stayed at Ma\u1e45kula Hills in Kosambi. However, historical Buddhist accounts suggest that two key events took place during this period:</p>\n<p>1) Venerable Pu\u1e47\u1e47a, after receiving permission from the Buddha, traveled to the country of Sun\u0101paranta.</p>\n<p>2) Queen Khema, the chief queen of King Bimbisara, became a disciple of the Buddha.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\t<b>According to MN:145</b> (Pu\u1e47\u1e47ov\u0101da Sutta), which was delivered to Venerable Pu\u1e47\u1e47a while the Buddha was staying at the Jetavana Monastery, the Blessed One may have traveled to S\u0101vatthi before the rainy season to offer advice to Venerable Pu\u1e47\u1e47a.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\t<b>According to tradition</b>, Queen Khema attained stream-entry while listening to the Buddha\u2019s sermon on the impurity of the body. Following this, the Buddha gave her a lengthy sermon, and she attained arahantship on the spot, still dressed in her royal attire. Later, she received permission from the king and became a disciple of the Buddha in R\u0101jagaha. <span id=\"Endnote11\">[<a href=\"#endnote11\">11</a>]</span> Although the scriptures do not record her ordination, she was one of the chief bhikkhuni disciples of the Blessed One, and the Buddha declared her the foremost among bhikkhunis with great wisdom. <span id=\"Endnote12\">[<a href=\"#endnote12\">12</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>End of the Sixth Rainy Season</p>\n<p>Tradition holds that after spending the sixth vassa at Mount Ma\u1e45kula, the Buddha traveled to R\u0101jagaha and took up residence at the Veluvana Monastery. <span id=\"Endnote13\">[<a href=\"#endnote13\">13</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page15_2/image4.png\" />\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>The Buddha in T\u0101vati\u1e43sa deva world Teaching Dhamma to Devas there</b> <span id=\"Endnote14\">[<a href=\"#endnote14\">14</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Seventh Vassa (Age 41)</p>\n<p>According to various sources, the Buddha spent his seventh rainy season in the T\u0101vatimsa deva world:</p>\n<p><b>1) </b>The seventh in the realm of the thirty-three gods\u2014T\u0101vati\u1e41sa. <i>(sattama\u1e41 T\u0101vati\u1e41sabhavane</i><b>).  </b><span id=\"Endnote15\">[<a href=\"#endnote15\">15</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b> </b><b>2)  </b>Preaching the most profound, hard-to-see, sweet Dhamma to the\u00a0<i>Maruts</i>, in the seventh Rains Retreat, the incomparable, glorious Sage, dwelt on the cool, large, stone throne of the Lord of Gods\u2014Sakka (<i>Gambh\u012bra-duddasa-tara\u1e41 madhura\u1e41 Dhamma\u1e41 Mar\u016bna\u1e41 desetv\u0101, atulo siri-sanniv\u0101so Muni Deva-Inda-s\u012btala-vis\u0101la-sil\u0101-\u0101sanasmi\u1e41, sattamamhi Vassamhi, v\u0101sa\u1e41 akar\u012b</i>).  <span id=\"Endnote16\">[<a href=\"#endnote16\">16</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>3)</b>  \u201cThe seventh\u00a0vassa\u00a0was observed on the Emerald Throne at the foot of Erythrina Indica tree in the celestial realm of\u00a0<u>T\u0101vati\u1e43sa</u>, preaching\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/abhidhamma#theravada\"><u>Abhidhamma</u></a>\u00a0discourses.\u201d <span id=\"Endnote17\">[<a href=\"#endnote17\">17</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>The Buddha\u2019s Divine Teaching in T\u0101vati\u1e43sa Devaloka</h2>\n<p>Tradition holds that when the Buddha ascended to T\u0101vati\u1e43sa Devaloka, a great assembly of celestial beings gathered to listen to his teachings. Among them was his late mother, Queen M\u0101y\u0101, who had passed away seven days after his birth and was reborn as a youthful deva named Santusita Deva in the Tusita heaven (see Section 2).</p>\n<p>Throughout the three-month vassa (rain retreat), the Buddha expounded the profound Abhidhamma to the devas and brahmas, illuminating the path to wisdom and liberation. Deeply moved by the sublime Dhamma, Santusita Deva attained the fruition of sot\u0101patti, the first stage of awakening, realizing the timeless truth her son had come to reveal to the world.<span id=\"Endnote18\">[<a href=\"#endnote18\">18</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>According to tradition, during this period, the Buddha would descend to the human realm to share these precious teachings with his foremost disciple, Venerable S\u0101riputta. Then, as promised, on the full moon night of the Assayuja month, the Buddha returned to the human world in radiant splendour. His body shone with six-coloured rays, illuminating the heavens and the earth. Accompanied by a vast retinue of devas on one side and brahmas on the other, he descended to Sa\u1e45kassanagara, where an immense gathering, led by Venerable S\u0101riputta, awaited his arrival. The entire town glowed with divine brilliance, reflecting the reverence and devotion of all present.</p>\n<p>Awestruck by the magnificent scene, Venerable S\u0101riputta respectfully approached the Blessed One and exclaimed,</p>\n<p><b><i>\u201cVenerable, never have we seen or heard of such resplendent glory! Indeed, you are loved, homered, and revered by devas, brahmas, and humans alike!\u201d</i></b></p>\n<p>In response, the Buddha revealed this profound truth:</p>\n<p><b>\u201cThose noble and wise ones are intent on meditation.</p>\n<p>They are devoted to renunciation and inner peace.</p>\n<p>Mindful and enlightened, such beings are beloved by all.\u201d </b>(Dhp:181)</p>\n<p><i>( ye dhir\u0101 jh\u0101napasut\u0101 nekkhamm\u016bpasame rat\u0101 sat\u012bmata\u1e43</p>\n<p>tesa\u1e43 sambuddh\u0101na\u1e43 dev\u0101 api pihayanti)</i></p>\n<p>As the Buddha\u2019s luminous words resounded, transformation unfolded, the monks who were disciples of Venerable S\u0101riputta attained arahantship, their minds utterly liberated. A great number of devotees in the congregation also reached sot\u0101patti fruition, forever stepping onto the path of awakening.</p>\n<p>Thus, the Buddha\u2019s compassionate journey to the celestial realm bore immeasurable fruit, bringing both gods and humans closer to the ultimate truth of Nibb\u0101na.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page15_2/image5.jpeg\" />\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>Map of Sankissa in relation to other\u00a0</b><b><i>Eight Great Places</i></b><b>\u00a0</b><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist_pilgrimage\"><b>Buddhist pilgrimage</b></a>, <b>Sa\u1e45kassanagara is identified as Sankisa Basantpur, in UP, India </b><span id=\"Endnote19\">[<a href=\"#endnote19\">19</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page15_2/image6.png\" />\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>Descent of the Buddha from the Tavatimsa Heaven\u00a0 </b><span id=\"Endnote20\">[<a href=\"#endnote20\">20</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>Note:</b></p>\n<p>Sankissa has ruins of ancient Buddhist monasteries, and other monuments from Buddhist and Hindu traditions.

Upon seeing the Buddha for the first time, the couple immediately recognized him as their own son from a past life and said:</p>\n<p><i>\u201c\u2026beloved son\u2026where have you been roaming about for such a long time after leaving us, your parents behind?\u201d</i><span id=\"Endnote34\">[<a href=\"#endnote34\">34</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>According to the commentary, Nakulapit\u0101 and his wife, Nakulam\u0101t\u0101, had been the Buddha\u2019s parents in five hundred past lives, which is why they continued to regard him as their son. <span id=\"Endnote35\">[<a href=\"#endnote35\">35</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Teachings Given to Nakulapit\u0101 and Nakulam\u0101t\u0101</h2>\n<h3>Advice for Couples Wishing for Happiness in This Life and Beyond</h3>\n<p>One day, Nakulapit\u0101 and Nakulam\u0101t\u0101 approached the Buddha and expressed their deep devotion to each other. They shared that they had lived together in harmony in their present life and wished to continue as husband and wife in future lives as well.</p>\n<p>In response, the Buddha offered them this profound teaching:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cBoth husband and wife are endowed with faith,</i></p>\n<p><i>charitable and self-controlled,</i></p>\n<p><i>living their lives righteously,</i></p>\n<p><i>addressing each other with pleasant words,</i></p>\n<p><i>Then many benefits accrue to them</i></p>\n<p><i>and they dwell at ease.</i></p>\n<p><i>Their enemies are saddened</i></p>\n<p><i>when both are the same in virtue.</i></p>\n<p><i>Having practiced the Dhamma here,</i></p>\n<p><i>the same in virtuous behaviour and observances,</i></p>\n<p><i>delighting after death in a deva world,</i></p>\n<p><i>they rejoice, enjoying sensual pleasures.  </i><span id=\"Endnote36\">[<a href=\"#endnote36\">36</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Nakulapit\u0101\u2019s Illness and Nakulam\u0101t\u0101\u2019s Reassurance</h3>\n<p>On one occasion, Nakulapit\u0101 fell gravely ill and became deeply worried about the future of his family. He was concerned about whether Nakulam\u0101t\u0101 would be able to support their children and manage the household on her own. Sensing his distress, Nakulam\u0101t\u0101 gently reassured him. She spoke of her strength, virtue, and unwavering faith as a lay follower of the Buddha. She assured him of her ability to care for the household, urging him to set aside his worries and find peace:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cDo not die full of concern, householder. To die full of concern is painful. To die full of concern has been criticized by the Blessed One. \u201d</i><span id=\"Endnote37\">[<a href=\"#endnote37\">37</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Hearing her words, Nakulapit\u0101 was filled with joy and relief, and remarkably, his illness began to subside. Later, he approached the Buddha and recounted this experience. In response, the Blessed One said:</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>It is truly your good fortune and gain, householder, that the housewife Nakulam\u0101t\u0101 has compassion for you, desires your good, and exhorts and instructs you. She is one of my white-robed females lay disciples who fulfill virtuous behaviour\u2026 who obtain internal serenity of mind\u2026 who have attained a foothold, a firm stand, assurance in this Dhamma and discipline\u2026 crossed over doubt\u2026 and become independent of others in the Teacher\u2019s teaching (</i>established in stream entry<i>). </i>\u201d <span id=\"Endnote38\">[<a href=\"#endnote38\">38</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3> Keeping the Mind Calm When the Body Is Sick</h3>\n<p>On one occasion, Nakulapit\u0101 approached the Buddha and sought his guidance, saying that as he had grown older, his body frequently fell ill. He asked the Blessed One for advice on how to maintain inner peace despite his physical ailments. In response, the Buddha said: <span id=\"Endnote39\">[<a href=\"#endnote39\">39</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\u201c So it is, householder, so it is! This body of yours is afflicted, weighed down, encumbered. If </i>anyone carrying around this body were to claim to be healthy even for a moment, what is that<i> due to other than foolishness? Therefore, householder, you should train yourself thus: \u2018Even though I am afflicted in body, my mind will be unafflicted\u2019\u201d.</i></p>\n<h3>Advice for a Good Rebirth</h3>\n<p>While the Buddha was residing in the Deer Park at Bhesakal\u0101, he delivered a discourse to Nakulam\u0101t\u0101, describing eight qualities of a virtuous wife that would lead to a favourable rebirth in the deva realm. <span id=\"Endnote40\">[<a href=\"#endnote40\">40</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Nakulapit\u0101\u2019s Six Noble Qualities</h3>\n<p>On another occasion, the Buddha declared that Nakulapit\u0101, by possessing six noble qualities\u2014unwavering confidence in the Buddha, Dhamma, and Sa\u1e45gha, noble virtuous conduct, profound knowledge, and noble liberation\u2014had attained certainty about the Tath\u0101gata and become a seer of the deathless, one who lived having realized the deathless. <span id=\"Endnote41\">[<a href=\"#endnote41\">41</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Thus, Nakulapit\u0101 and Nakulam\u0101t\u0101 not only devotedly supported the Buddha and the Sa\u1e45gha but also deeply understood the Dhamma with great reverence. As a result, they both attained the stage of stream-entry\u2014the first step on the Noble Path\u2014laying the foundation for ultimate enlightenment and liberation from the cycle of suffering in sa\u1e43s\u0101ra.</p>\n<h3>Teachings Given to Venerable Anuruddha</h3>\n<p>The <i>Anuruddha Sutta</i> (AN 8:30) records that while the Buddha was residing among the Bhaggas at Su\u1e43sum\u0101ragiri in the Deer Park at Bhesakal\u0101 Grove, he visited Venerable Anuruddha, who was then staying at the Eastern Bamboo Park in the Cetiya country. During this visit, the Buddha delivered a discourse, the key teachings of which are summarized in section 14.2 of this compilation.</p>\n<h3>Teachings Given to Prince Bodhi</h3>\n<p>On another occasion, while residing at the Kokanada Palace in the Bhagga country, the Buddha was visited by Prince Bodhi, who approached him with a question:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cVenerable sir, when a bhikkhu finds the Tath\u0101gata to discipline him, how long is it until by realising for himself with direct knowledge?\u201d</i><span id=\"Endnote42\">[<a href=\"#endnote42\">42</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Blessed One imparted the following teaching to Prince Bodhi:</p>\n<p>A follower of the Buddha who seeks to train under him must possess five essential qualities:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1)\t<b>Confidence in the Buddha</b> \u2013 unwavering faith in his enlightenment and teachings.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2)\t<b>Good health</b> \u2013 being free from illness and affliction to undertake the practice effectively.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>3)\t<b>Honesty and sincerity</b> \u2013 maintaining truthfulness in thought, speech, and action.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>4)\t<b>Diligence in practice</b> \u2013 being energetic in abandoning unwholesome states and cultivating wholesome qualities.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>5)\t<b>Wisdom</b> \u2013 possessing insight into the arising and passing away of phenomena, a noble and penetrating wisdom that leads to the complete cessation of suffering.</p>\n<p>When a bhikkhu possesses these five qualities and trains under the guidance of the Buddha, he may attain liberation within seven years, six years, or even within a single month, depending on the development of his faculties. In some cases, he may realize the truth in just half a month, seven days and nights, or even within a single day and night.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, if a bhikkhu endowed with these five factors of striving finds a Tath\u0101gata to guide him, he may attain realization in a single session of instruction\u2014receiving guidance in the evening and reaching distinction by morning, or receiving instruction in the morning and attaining insight by evening.</p>\n<p>Deeply inspired by the Buddha\u2019s words, Prince Bodhi rejoiced in the teaching and became a devoted lay follower. <span id=\"Endnote43\">[<a href=\"#endnote43\">43</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>With this inspiring teaching of the Blessed One , we conclude this section, which explored the Blessed One\u2019s rainy season retreats during his sixth to eighth vassa, spent in three different locations.

He was childless and desired a son. He had heard that people can fulfil their wishes by making special offerings to the Buddha, so he spread the white cloth with the idea: \u201cIf I am to have a son, the Buddha will step on the cloth; if I am not to have a son, he will not step on the cloth.\u201d The Buddha knew that by reason of past evil kamma, he and his wife were destined to remain childless. Hence, he did not step on the cloth. Later he laid down a disciplinary rule prohibiting the bhikkhus from stepping on a white cloth, but subsequently modified the rule to allow bhikkhus to step on a cloth as a blessing for householders.

Various scriptures mention the Blessed One residing in the Kosamb\u012b region during this period. However, they do not explicitly state that he spent the entire ninth vassa there. Based on the following sources, we can reasonably conclude that the Buddha spent this rainy season in Kosamb\u012b:</p>\n<p>1) \u201cThe ninth near Kosamb\u012b \u201c (<i>navama\u1e41 Kosambiya\u1e41) </i><span id=\"Endnote1\">[<a href=\"#endnote1\">1</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2) \u201cThe Ornament of the Three Worlds, the Victorious Bird-King,\u00a0having destroyed the arrogance of a great many snake-like sectarians, who had various opinions, in the ninth Rains Retreat, dwelt in the agreeable, very fair, Silk-cotton Wood near to Kosamb\u012b .\u201d <span id=\"Endnote2\">[<a href=\"#endnote2\">2</a>]</span> (<b>n\u0101n\u0101mat\u0101tibahutitthiyasappadappa\u1e41- hantv\u0101 tilokatilako navamamhi vasse</p>\n<p>v\u0101sa\u1e41 ak\u0101si rucire atidassan\u012bye- kosambisimbalivane jinapakkhir\u0101j\u0101).</b></p>\n<p>3) \u201cThe Buddha spent his ninth rainy season in Kosamb\u012b. Three wealthy men from Kosamb\u012b\u2014Ghosaka (Ghosita), Kukkudha, and Pavarika\u2014heard of the Buddha\u2019s presence and travelled to Jetavana Monastery in S\u0101vatth\u012b to pay their respects. Deeply inspired, they invited the Blessed One to visit Kosamb\u012b. In anticipation of his arrival, each of them constructed a grand monastery: Ghosaka built \u2018Ghosit\u0101r\u0101ma,\u2019 Kukkudha (also known as Kukku\u1e6da) established \u2018Kukkud\u0101r\u0101ma,\u2019 and Pavarika created \u2018P\u0101v\u0101rik\u0101mbavana,\u2019 a mango grove monastery.\u201d<span id=\"Endnote3\">[<a href=\"#endnote3\">3</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>According to Tradition the Buddha arrived from Jetavana Monastery to Kosamb\u012b  region with a large gathering of Sangha. The three wealthy patrons took turns inviting the Buddha and the Sangha to their homes for a meal. On the first day, the Blessed One and his disciples dined at Ghosaka\u2019s residence, after which he formally received Ghosit\u0101r\u0101ma as a monastery. On the second day, Kukkudha hosted the Buddha and the Sangha, offering them Kukkud\u0101r\u0101ma as a place of residence. Finally, on the third day, the Blessed One visited Pavarika and his family, who presented P\u0101v\u0101rik\u0101mbavana, the mango grove, as a dwelling for the Buddha and the Sangha. <span id=\"Endnote4\">[<a href=\"#endnote4\">4</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Where is Kosamb\u012b?</h2>\n<p>During the time of the Buddha, Kosamb\u012b was the capital of the Vatsa (also known as Vamsa) kingdom. It was located on the northern bank of the Yamun\u0101 River and served as a major centre for river trade. According to tradition, Kosamb\u012b was a prosperous city, home to many wealthy merchants. As previously mentioned, three prominent businessmen from this city generously donated three monasteries to the Buddha and the Sangha.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page15_3/image1.png\" />\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>Location of Kosamb\u012b - During the time of the Buddha</b><span id=\"Endnote5\">[<a href=\"#endnote5\">5</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page15_3/image2.png\" />\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>Modern day map of Kosamb\u012b (Kaushambi), </b>Distance from Shravasti to Kaushambi is 564.8km <span id=\"Endnote6\">[<a href=\"#endnote6\">6</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page15_3/image3.jpeg\" />\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>Ruins of Ghoshitarama monastery in Kosamb\u012b</b><span id=\"Endnote7\">[<a href=\"#endnote7\">7</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>The Three Monasteries Donated in Kosamb\u012b</h2>\n<h3>Ghosita Monastery</h3>\n<p>According to the scriptures, numerous discourses were delivered by the Buddha and his prominent disciples at Ghosita Monastery in Kosamb\u012b. One significant discourse, the <i>Kosamb\u012b Sutta</i> (MN 48), which addresses a well-known dispute among the Sangha, was preached by the Blessed One while residing at this monastery. (The key teachings from this sutta are discussed below.)</p>\n<p>The following excerpts from the <i>Udana</i> confirm that the Buddha resided at Ghosita Monastery in Kosamb\u012b.</p>\n<p><i>\u201cOne time the Gracious One was dwelling near Kosamb\u012b, in Ghosita's Monastery.

The following scriptures confirm this:</p>\n<p>The <i>Vinaya Pitaka</i> mentions an event that took place in this monastery, which was situated in Pataliputta:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cOn that occasion there were a number of senior monks\u2014Venerable Nilav\u0101s\u012b, Venerable S\u0101\u1e47av\u0101s\u012b, Venerable Gotaka, Venerable Bhagu, and Venerable Pha\u1e37ikasant\u0101na\u2014staying at P\u0101\u1e6daliputta in the Kukku\u1e6da Monastery.

Several suttas reference the Buddha and his disciples residing there at different times, including: <i>Kevaddha Sutta</i> (DN:11), <i>Mah\u0101parinibb\u0101na Sutta</i> (DN:16)</p>\n<p><i>Sampas\u0101dan\u012bya Sutta</i> (DN: 28)</p>\n<p>A sutta in the <i>Sa\u1e41yutta Nik\u0101ya</i> further confirms that P\u0101v\u0101rika\u2019s Mango Grove was situated in N\u0101land\u0101:</p>\n<p><i>\u201c On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at N\u0101land\u0101 in P\u0101v\u0101rika\u2019s Mango Grove.

P\u0101v\u0101rika of N\u0101land\u0101, having heard the Buddha\u2019s teachings, became his follower and built a monastery for the Buddha and the Sa\u1e45gha within his mango grove. This monastery became known as <i>P\u0101v\u0101rik\u0101mbavana</i> (DA.iii.873; MA.ii.594; SA.iii.169).</p>\n<p>Based on this information, it is clear that <i>Ghosita Monastery</i> was definitely located near Kosamb\u012b. However, the exact locations of <i>Kukkutar\u0101ma</i> and <i>P\u0101v\u0101rik\u0101mbavana</i> remain uncertain. It is possible that two individuals named <i>Kukkuta</i>, one from Kosamb\u012b and the other from Magadha, built monasteries with the same name, <i>Kukkutar\u0101ma</i>, and offered them to the Buddha and the Sa\u1e45gha.</p>\n<p>According to the scriptures, the only confirmed <i>Kukkutar\u0101ma</i> during the Buddha\u2019s time was in P\u0101\u1e6daliputta (Magadha). Likewise, there may have been two wealthy donors named <i>P\u0101v\u0101rika</i>\u2014one from Kosamb\u012b, who donated a mango grove while the Buddha was dwelling there, and another from N\u0101land\u0101, who also offered his mango grove to the Buddha.</p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page15_3/image4.jpeg\" />\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>Map showing the location of the 3 monasteries. </b><span id=\"Endnote10\">[<a href=\"#endnote10\">10</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Significant Event Before the Ninth Rainy Season</h2>\n<p>The <i>M\u0101ga\u1e47\u1e0diya Sutta</i> (<i>Snp 4.9</i>) in the <i>Sutta Nip\u0101ta</i> recounts an encounter between the Buddha and a brahmin named M\u0101ga\u1e47\u1e0diya, in which the Blessed One imparted Dhamma teachings to him. While the sutta itself does not specify the time or location of this meeting, the commentary suggests that it took place while the Buddha was traveling to Kosamb\u012b. He was on his way there in response to an invitation from three wealthy men of the city, who had requested him to spend his ninth rainy season in Kosamb\u012b.</p>\n<h3>Brief Account of the Event</h3>\n<p>M\u0101ga\u1e47\u1e0diya, a brahmin from the Kuru country, had a wife and a remarkably beautiful daughter. One day, as the Buddha was passing through the region on foot, he stopped to rest. Upon seeing the Buddha\u2019s footprints, M\u0101ga\u1e47\u1e0diya immediately recognized them as those of a great man. Excited, he called his wife and daughter and proposed that his daughter be given in marriage to the Buddha.</p>\n<p>The Buddha, however, declined the proposal, explaining that he had renounced all sensual pleasures. He then spoke the following words:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cHaving seen Ta\u1e47h\u0101, Arat\u012b, and Rag\u0101,</i><span id=\"Endnote11\">[<a href=\"#endnote11\">11</a>]</span><i></p>\n<p>I did not have any desire for sexual intercourse,</p>\n<p>so why should I desire this, full of urine and faeces?</p>\n<p>I would not wish to touch her even with my foot\u201d</i></p>\n<p><i>\u201cHaving left home to roam without abode,</p>\n<p>in the village the muni is intimate with none.</p>\n<p>Void of sensual pleasures, without preferences,</p>\n<p>he would not engage in contentious talk with people\u201d</i></p>\n<p><i>\u201cFor one detached from perception there are no knots;</p>\n<p>for one liberated by wisdom there are no delusions.</p>\n<p>But those who have grasped perceptions and views</p>\n<p>wander in the world creating friction.\u201d</i><span id=\"Endnote12\">[<a href=\"#endnote12\">12</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Having realized the Dhamma, the Brahmin M\u0101ga\u1e47\u1e0diya and his wife sought refuge in the Buddha and attained the noble state of non-returners.</p>\n<p>However, their daughter showed no interest in the Buddha\u2019s teachings. Proud of her beauty, she was enraged when the Buddha described the human body as merely a vessel filled with urine and filth. Later, she became the queen of King Udena of Kosamb\u012b. When the Buddha resided there, she repeatedly attempted to trouble both him and the Sangha. Harbouring deep resentment, she eventually orchestrated a plot to have King Udena\u2019s other queen, S\u0101mavati, and her entourage burned to death after S\u0101mavati had taken refuge in the Buddha. <span id=\"Endnote13\">[<a href=\"#endnote13\">13</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>At that time, the Buddha was residing in Kosamb\u012b.

A brief summary is provided below:</p>\n<h3>The Six Principles of Cordiality</h3>\n<p><i>\u201cBhikkhus, there are these </i><b><i>Six Principles of Cordiality</i></b><i> (Cha dhamm\u0101 s\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u0131\u0304y\u0101 ) that create love and respect and conduce to cohesion, to non-dispute, to unity\u201d</i></p>\n<p><b>They are: </b>(1-3) to maintain bodily\u2026verbal\u2026mental acts of loving-kindness both in public and in private towards his companions in the holy life. 4) share things in common with his virtuous companions in the holy life; without making reservations, he shares with them any gain \u2026 obtained in a way that accords with the Dhamma, including even the mere contents of his bowl. 5) dwells both in public and in private possessing in common with his companions in the holy life those virtues that are unbroken\u2026commended by the wise\u2026 and conducive to Sam\u0101dhi. 6) dwells both in public and in private possessing in common with his companions in the holy life that view that is noble and emancipating, and leads one who practises in accordance with it to the complete destruction of suffering\u2014Right View. <span id=\"Endnote20\">[<a href=\"#endnote20\">20</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Seven Extraordinary knowledges (seven great reviewing knowledges-<i>mah\u0101paccavekka\u1e47\u0101\u1e47a</i>) of a stream-winner: <span id=\"Endnote21\">[<a href=\"#endnote21\">21</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1) the knowledge that there is no obsession in the mind which prevents him to see things as they actually are 2) the knowledge that when he possesses the Right View and cultivate it, he can personally obtain serenity and quenching 3) the knowledge that there is no recluse outside the Buddha\u2019s dispensation possess the Right View 4) the knowledge that he possesses character of a person who has the Right View 5) the knowledge that though he may engaged in various matters for the companions of his spiritual life, but has keen regard from higher virtue\u2026training \u2026mind (this is the character of a person who possesses right view) 6) the knowledge that he possesses the strength of a person who has the Right View :when the Dhamma and Discipline proclaimed by the Tath\u0101gata is being taught, he heeds it, gives it attention, engages it with all his mind, hears the Dhamma as with eager ears 7) the knowledge that he possesses the strength of a person who has the Right View:  when the Dhamma and Discipline proclaimed by the Tath\u0101gata is being taught, he gains inspiration in the meaning, gains inspiration in the Dhamma, gains gladness connected with the Dhamma.</p>\n<p>The Buddha concluded thus:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cWhen a noble disciple is thus possessed of seven factors, he has well sought the character for realisation of the fruit of stream-entry.

At the same time, King D\u012bgh\u012bti ruled over Kosala, but he was poor, had little power, and governed only a small kingdom with limited resources.</p>\n<p>One day, King Brahmadatta launched an attack on Kosala. Upon hearing of the invasion, King D\u012bgh\u012bti realized that he was no match for Brahmadatta\u2019s forces. Knowing he could not withstand even a single strike, he decided to flee before the enemy arrived. Together with his pregnant queen, he escaped the city and sought refuge in a potter\u2019s house on the outskirts of Benares.</p>\n<p>In due time, the queen gave birth to a son, whom they named D\u012bgh\u0101vu. Aware that King Brahmadatta would kill them if he discovered their whereabouts, King D\u012bgh\u012bti took his son to a safe location outside the city and made arrangements for the young prince to live there in safety.</p>\n<p>A spy who was familiar with King D\u012bgh\u012bti discovered the whereabouts of the exiled king and queen and reported it to King Brahmadatta. Upon hearing this, King Brahmadatta ordered his soldiers to capture them. The soldiers bound King D\u012bgh\u012bti and his queen, paraded them through the streets, and then executed them by dismembering their bodies into four parts, placing the remains at the four cardinal directions as a warning.</p>\n<p>At that time, Prince D\u012bgh\u0101vu, eager to see his parents, entered the city. To his horror, he witnessed the brutal fate that had befallen them. As he approached, King D\u012bgh\u012bti, seeing his son, spoke his final words:</p>\n<p><i>\u2018My dear D\u012bgh\u0101vu, see neither long nor short. For hatred never ends through hatred;</i></p>\n<p><i>hatred only ends through love\u2026</i> <i>The wise will understand\u2019.</i></p>\n<p>On that occasion, the young prince grasped his father\u2019s advice and chose not to react harshly. Witnessing his parents' tragic demise, he discreetly bribed the guards, retrieved their bodies, and ensured they received a proper funeral outside the city. Overwhelmed with grief, he retreated into the wilderness, where he wept his heart out. Later, disguised as a young Brahmin, he approached the royal elephant trainer and said:</p>\n<p><i>\u2018Teacher, I wish to learn your profession.\u2019</i></p>\n<p><i>\u2018Well then, young brahmin, I\u2019ll teach you.\u2019 </i></p>\n<p>Before long, the young prince had settled into a routine\u2014rising early each morning, singing melodiously, and playing his lute in the elephant stables. King Brahmadatta, who also woke early, happened to hear the enchanting music. Curious, he inquired about the musician, and his attendants informed him of the young Brahmin residing in the elephant shed. Intrigued, the king ordered his guards to bring the young man to the palace.</p>\n<p>Pleased by the Brahmin\u2019s demeanour and conduct, the king appointed him as one of his attendants. The prince diligently served the king, waking before him and retiring only after him. He carried out his duties willingly, speaking and behaving with kindness and grace. In time, King Brahmadatta grew to trust him deeply, placing him in a position of great confidence.</p>\n<p>One day, while hunting with the prince, the king decided to rest. As he lay down, he placed his head on the prince\u2019s lap and drifted into sleep. At that moment, the prince reflected:</p>\n<p>\"This king has brought great misfortune upon us. He seized our kingdom\u2026 he took the lives of my mother and father. Now, the opportunity for revenge is in my hands.\" With that thought, the prince drew his sword.</p>\n<p>But then, a memory surfaced\u2014his father\u2019s final words before his death: <i>\"My dear D\u012bgh\u0101vu, see neither long nor short. For hatred never ends through hatred; hatred only ends through love.\"</i></p>\n<p>Reflecting on these words, he realized he could not ignore his father\u2019s wisdom. With a deep breath, he returned the sword to its scabbard.</p>\n<p>Three times, the desire for vengeance burned within him, and three times, he reached for his weapon. But each time, his father\u2019s words echoed in his mind, guiding him away from violence.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, King Brahmadatta awoke with a start, his face pale with fear. Alarmed, he exclaimed, \u201cI just had a terrifying dream\u2014Prince D\u012bgh\u0101vu, the son of King D\u012bgh\u012bti of Kosala, was attacking me with a sword!\u201d</p>\n<p>At that moment, the prince firmly seized the king\u2019s head and declared, \u201cSir, I am that very Prince D\u012bgh\u0101vu, son of King D\u012bgh\u012bti of Kosala. You have brought suffering upon us\u2014you killed my parents. And now, the moment for my revenge has come.\u201d</p>\n<p>The king fell to his knees, bowing his head at the prince\u2019s feet, and pleaded, <b>\u201cDear D\u012bgh\u0101vu, I beg you\u2014spare my life.\u201d</b></p>\n<p>The prince looked at him and replied, <b>\u201cWho am I to grant you mercy? It is you, sir, who should spare my life.\u201d</b></p>\n<p>Moved by these words, the king said, <b>\u201cThen, D\u012bgh\u0101vu, if you spare my life, I shall spare yours.\u201d</b></p>\n<p>With that, both the king and D\u012bgh\u0101vu chose to let go of vengeance and spare each other\u2019s lives. They clasped hands in a solemn vow, promising never to bring harm to one another.<span id=\"Endnote27\">[<a href=\"#endnote27\">27</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Not long after, the king turned to D\u012bgh\u0101vu and asked,</p>\n<p>\u201cD\u012bgh\u0101vu, what did your father mean by the words he spoke to you before his death?\u201d</p>\n<p>The prince respectfully replied, \u201c<b>When he said, \u2018Not long</b>,\u2019 he meant, \u2018<b>Do not hold on to hatred for too long</b>.\u2019 When he said, \u2018<b>Not short</b>,\u2019 he meant, \u2018<b>Do not be too quick to sever ties with friends.</b>\u2019 And when he said, \u2018<b>For hatred never ends through hatred; hatred only ends through love,</b>\u2019 he was speaking of your actions\u2014the killing of my mother and father. Had I sought revenge and taken your life, your loyal supporters would have killed me in return. Then my supporters would have avenged my death, and the cycle of hatred would have continued endlessly. But instead, you spared my life, and I spared yours. In this way, hatred is ended not through vengeance, but through love.</p>\n<p>Hearing these wise words, the king was deeply moved by the prince\u2019s wisdom and sense of justice. In admiration, he restored to him his father\u2019s rightful kingdom.</p>\n<p>At the conclusion of this story, the Blessed One said:</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>In this way, monks, those kings who had the authority to punish were actually patient and gentle. But right here, you who\u2019ve gone forth on this well-proclaimed spiritual path, do you shine with your patience and gentleness?\u201d </i><span id=\"Endnote28\">[<a href=\"#endnote28\">28</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>According to the scriptures, the stubborn monks paid no heed to the Buddha\u2019s words and refused to set aside their quarrel.</p>\n<p>Seeing this, the Buddha thought, <b>\u201cThese foolish men are blinded by their emotions. It will not be easy to make them see reason.\u201d</b> With that, he rose from his seat and walked away.</p>\n<p>The following day, the Buddha spoke to the monks, reciting these verses:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cThey abused me, they hit me,</i></p>\n<p><i>They defeated me, they robbed me.\u2019</i></p>\n<p><i>For those who carry on like this,</i></p>\n<p><i>Hatred cannot end\u2026</i></p>\n<p><i>For those who do not carry on like this,</i></p>\n<p><i>Hatred has an end.</i></p>\n<p><i>For never does hatred</i></p>\n<p><i>End through hatred;</i></p>\n<p><i>Only through love does it end\u2014</i></p>\n<p><i>This is an ancient law.</i></p>\n<p><i>Those breaking bones and killing,</i></p>\n<p><i>Those taking cows, horses, and wealth,</i></p>\n<p><i>Those plundering the country,</i></p>\n<p><i>Even they can stay together\u2014</i></p>\n<p><i>Why then cannot you?\u201d.</i></p>\n<p>The Buddha then emphasized the importance of living in harmony with good friends. He further advised that if one cannot find wise and virtuous companionship, it is better to walk alone than to associate with those who engage in harmful deeds. <span id=\"Endnote29\">[<a href=\"#endnote29\">29</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Reasons for Schism in the Sa\u1e45gha</h3>\n<p>Regarding the dispute among the bhikkhus, the Blessed One explained:</p>\n<p><b>\u201c\u2026Seeing these four advantages, an evil bhikkhu takes delight in creating schism within the Sa\u1e45gha.\u201d</b></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1)\tA corrupt bhikkhu who is immoral thinks:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cIf the other bhikkhus discover my immoral conduct, they will expel me.

The Buddha emphasized to his disciples that these impurities must be abandoned in order to cultivate deep states of meditation (the four jh\u0101nas), which ultimately lead to liberation.</p>\n<h4><i>Summary of the Discourse:</i></h4>\n<p>The Buddha revealed to the three venerables the factors that hinder the development of Samadhi: doubt, inattention (not focusing the mind on the object of meditation), fear, excessive joy, lack of interest in achieving Samadhi, excessive energy, insufficient energy, intense desire (for Samadhi), focusing the mind on various signs, and excessive attachment to forms. By eliminating these obstacles, one can attain the four jh\u0101nas, which lead to insight. The Buddha also shared how, before his enlightenment, he practiced and gradually abandoned these imperfections, eventually achieving liberation through deep meditation.</p>\n<p>Concluding his sermon, the Blessed One said:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cWhen, Anuruddha, I had developed Samadhi with applied thought and sustained thought\u2026 when I had developed Samadhi accompanied by equanimity, the knowledge and vision arose in me: \u2018My deliverance is unshakeable; this is my last birth; now there is no renewal of being.\u2019\u201d</i><span id=\"Endnote49\">[<a href=\"#endnote49\">49</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>That is what the Buddha said.

Despite being a beast, the elephant may have sensed the Buddha\u2019s great compassion.

Content to be away from his herd and living near such a noble being, he thought:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cPreviously, when I was surrounded by the other elephants, I was not at ease.

At that time, the Brahmin Kasi Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja was engaged in ploughing his fields with the help of many other farmers. As the Blessed One approached the area where food was being distributed, he stood quietly to one side. Seeing him standing for alms, the Brahmin Kasi Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja addressed him and said: <span id=\"Endnote17\">[<a href=\"#endnote17\">17</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\u201cRecluse, I plough and sow, and when I have ploughed and sown, I eat. You too, ascetic, ought to plough and sow; then, when you have ploughed and sown, you will eat.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>The Buddha replied:</p>\n<p><i>\"I too, Brahmin, plough and sow, and when I have ploughed and sown, I eat.\"</i></p>\n<p>Perplexed, the Brahmin Kasi Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja could not understand how the Buddha cultivated fields, harvested crops, and ate the food. Curious, he asked:</p>\n<p><i>\"You claim to be a man who works the plough, but I do not see your ploughing. How can this be?\u201d</i></p>\n<p>Buddha then described his way of ploughing and reaping as follows:</p>\n<p><i>\"Faith is my seed, and austerity the rain\u2014Wisdom serves as my yoke and plough.</p>\n<p>Shame is the plough-pole, and the mind the yoke-tie\u2014Mindfulness is my ploughshare and goad. With my body and speech well-guarded, and my appetite for food controlled,</p>\n<p>I wield truth as my weeding-hook and gentleness as my means of unyoking.</i></p>\n<p><i>Energy is my beast of burden, carrying me toward freedom from bondage.</p>\n<p>It moves forward without stopping, to that place where sorrow does not exist.</i></p>\n<p><i>Thus, this sacred ploughing is performed, yielding the fruit of the Deathless.</p>\n<p>And having completed this work of ploughing, one is liberated from all suffering.\" </i><span id=\"Endnote18\">[<a href=\"#endnote18\">18</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Brahmin Kasi Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja had the wisdom to recognize that he was in the presence of a Fully Enlightened Buddha\u2014one who had attained the Deathless by cultivating the five faculties: faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration (samadhi), and wisdom. Moved by this realization, he sought refuge in the Triple Gem for life and became a devoted lay follower of the Buddha.</p>\n<p>According to the <i>Sutta Nip\u0101ta</i> (Snp 1.4: <i>With Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja the Farmer</i>), after establishing deep faith, Brahmin Kasi Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja renounced worldly life and went forth under the guidance of the Blessed One. Through ardent practice, he ultimately attained arahantship.</p>\n<p><i>Summary of the Discourse:</i><b> </b><span id=\"Endnote19\">[<a href=\"#endnote19\">19</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>On a spiritual journey, one must first establish faith, as it serves as the foundation for all wholesome qualities. Faith is likened to a seed planted in the soil of spirituality. Just as a seed needs rain to grow into a strong plant, virtue and restraint in bodily, verbal, and mental actions nourish and strengthen faith, allowing it to take root and flourish in the spiritual path.</p>\n<p>Shame and fear of wrongdoing (<i>hiri</i> and <i>ottappa</i>) are compared to the twin poles of a plough, guiding one's moral discipline. Concentration (<i>sam\u0101dhi</i>), generated through the unification of the mind, acts as the rope that secures the yoke. Mindfulness (<i>sati</i>) is essential, just as a farmer needs control over his plough. In the same way, the Buddha possesses deep insight and wisdom, which serve as his tools for cultivating the spiritual path.</p>\n<p>By upholding the Truth of the Dhamma, the Buddha has uprooted the weeds of falsehood.</p>\n<p>Through moderation in eating, he has restrained his physical cravings. His two forms of energy\u2014both physical and mental\u2014are likened to the powerful oxen that drive the plough of right exertion, leading him toward complete liberation. The Buddha\u2019s Dhamma-ploughing ultimately bears the supreme fruit of Nibb\u0101na.</p>\n<h5>According to Commentary:</h5>\n<p>The commentary further explains that the \"fruit\" in this discourse refers to arahantship, which is described as <i>soracca</i>\u2014meaning delight in the highest good, Nibb\u0101na (<i>sundare nibb\u0101ne ratatt\u0101</i>). The Buddha declares, <i>\u201cBy attaining arahantship at the foot of the Bodhi Tree, I am fully liberated and will never again come under the yoke of sufferin</i>g.\u201d</p>\n<p>Nibb\u0101na is called <i>Yogakkhema</i>\u2014the state of complete security, free from all bonds. The phrase <i>\"To where, having gone, one does not sorrow\"</i> (<i>yattha gantv\u0101 na socati</i>) is explained in the commentary (<i>Spk</i>) as referring to the unconditioned state of Nibb\u0101na, where all the darts of suffering are removed once and for all. <span id=\"Endnote20\">[<a href=\"#endnote20\">20</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>A Simple Explanation of This Sutta</i><b>: </b><span id=\"Endnote21\">[<a href=\"#endnote21\">21</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Just as we cultivate crops in a field, we can also cultivate excellent qualities in the field of the mind. The Buddha refers to <i>Yogakkhema</i> (Pali: <i>yogakhema</i>) as the boundless harvest that arises from inner cultivation. <i>Yogakkhema</i> is the state of complete pacification, where the mind is freed from emotional fermentations and the root causes of suffering and grief are eradicated. In this state, one attains perfect well-being, deep peace, and ultimate awakening.</p>\n<p>Conviction (<i>saddh\u0101</i>), or faith, is not blind belief but arises from careful analysis of the teachings, personal experimentation, and the resulting certainty about the path. Conviction serves as the seed of spiritual cultivation\u2014one that is not ordinary but has the power to completely transform the field of the mind. It fuels the zeal necessary for the journey, providing a clear and reasoned determination to walk the path.</p>\n<p>Austerity is like abundant rain, nourishing the seed and fostering growth. It represents the willingness to strive and endure hardships along the way. Wisdom acts as the yoke and plough, turning over the soil of the mind to prepare it for deeper cultivation. Shame (<i>hiri</i>) functions like the plough-pole, guiding the farmer\u2019s tool in the right direction, ensuring the field is cultivated with care and precision. The sense of shame naturally prevents one from engaging in unwholesome actions, acting as an inner safeguard. The mind serves as the strap that keeps the yoke steady on the oxen, ensuring stability on the path. Mindfulness, carefully cultivated, functions as both the ploughshare and the goad, skilfully guiding one to observe each arising moment with clarity and precision.</p>\n<p>With restraint in body, speech, and consumption, one gains the ability to discern truthfully between what is wholesome and unwholesome. This discernment allows the weeds of unwholesome habits to be uprooted, clearing the ground for spiritual growth. Once the field of the mind is purified and made fertile, the most refined qualities can take root and flourish.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, one\u2019s own unwavering perseverance\u2014both heroic and joyous\u2014becomes the strong oxen that pull the plough forward, carrying one steadily toward true well-being, never turning back.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page15_4/image4.png\" />\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>Kasi Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja listening to the Blessed One\u2019s teachings </b><span id=\"Endnote22\">[<a href=\"#endnote22\">22</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>We will conclude the eleventh vassa with the story of how Kasi Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja became a devoted lay follower of the Buddha.</p>\n<h1>The Twelfth Rainy Season at Vera\u00f1ja</h1>\n<p>According to the scriptures, during the twelfth rainy season, the Buddha, accompanied by about five hundred monks, accepted an invitation from a Brahmin named Vera\u00f1j\u0101 and arrived at the village (or town) of Vera\u00f1ja to spend the retreat there.</p>\n<p>It is said that after listening to a discourse by the Blessed One, Brahmin Vera\u00f1j\u0101 was deeply moved by the teachings.

Finally, after realizing the truth of the Buddha\u2019s teachings, the brahmin was filled with joy and said: <span id=\"Endnote40\">[<a href=\"#endnote40\">40</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The brahmin, who was not convinced by the respond of the Buddha, pointed out eight factors <span id=\"Endnote41\">[<a href=\"#endnote41\">41</a>]</span> showing the Blessed Ones\u2019 behaviour and conduct is not acceptable to the brahmin community.</p>\n<p>The Buddha, who understood the Brahmin's mind, very kindly explained each point and explained that the Tath\u0101gata behaved and acted in accordance with the Dhamma in a good manner.  Finally, having understood the Buddha\u2019s teachings and being glad, he said:</p>\n<p><i>\"Master Gotama is truly the foremost! Master Gotama is the wisest! Excellent, Master Gotama!

At that time, Pah\u0101r\u0101da, the ruler of the asuras, approached the Buddha, paid homage to him, and sat respectfully to one side.</p>\n<p>The Buddha then asked Pah\u0101r\u0101da whether the asuras took delight in the vast ocean. In response, Pah\u0101r\u0101da described the remarkable and wondrous qualities of the great ocean that brought joy to the asuras. Curious, he then asked the Buddha how many extraordinary and marvelous qualities the bhikkhus recognized in the Dhamma.</p>\n<p>In reply, the Buddha described eight astounding and remarkable qualities of the Dhamma and the discipline within his dispensation, which his disciples deeply cherished: <span id=\"Endnote43\">[<a href=\"#endnote43\">43</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Buddha then described eight astounding and amazing qualities in the Dhamma and discipline of his dispensation which his disciples take delight in:</p>\n<h4><i>Eight Wonderful Qualities of the Dhamma</i></h4>\n<p></p>\n<p>1)\tIn the Dhamma and discipline, the attainment of final knowledge happens through gradual training.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2)\tWhen the Buddha prescribes a training rule, his disciples uphold it unwaveringly, even at the cost of their lives.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>3)\tThe <i>Sa\u1e45gha</i> does not associate with individuals who are immoral or of bad character; instead, such persons are expelled in accordance with the rules.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>4)\tUpon becoming disciples, individuals renounce their social status and identify solely as followers of the Buddha.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>5)\tEven as many <i>bhikkhus</i> attain final <i>Nibb\u0101na</i>, <i>Nibb\u0101na</i> itself remains neither diminished nor replenished.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>6)\tThis Dhamma and discipline possesses a single, unique taste\u2014the taste of liberation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>7)\tThe Dhamma and discipline contain many precious elements, including the Thirty-Seven Factors of Enlightenment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>8)\tThis Dhamma and discipline is the dwelling place of great beings\u2014the noble ones who have attained the four stages of awakening, from stream-entry to arahantship.</p>\n<h2>The Dispensation of Former Buddhas</h2>\n<p>According to the <i>Vinaya Pitaka</i>, this event took place during the twelfth rainy season while the Blessed One was residing in Vera\u00f1j\u0101. <span id=\"Endnote44\">[<a href=\"#endnote44\">44</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>On one occasion, Venerable S\u0101riputta approached the Buddha and asked:</p>\n<p><i>\"Which Buddhas established a long-lasting spiritual dispensation, and which did not?\"</i></p>\n<p>In response, the Blessed One said:</p>\n<p><i>\"S\u0101riputta, the spiritual life established by the Buddhas Vipass\u012b, Sikh\u012b, and Vessabh\u016b did not endure for long. However, the spiritual life established by the Buddhas Kakusandha, Kon\u0101gamana, and Kassapa remained for a significant period.</i><b>\"</b></p>\n<p>The Buddha then elaborated further:</p>\n<h3>Reasons for the Short Duration of a Dispensation</h3>\n<p>The spiritual dispensations of the Buddhas Vipass\u012b, Sikh\u012b, and Vessabh\u016b did not endure for long because they did not make a concerted effort to provide detailed teachings to their disciples. They delivered only a few discourses\u2014whether in prose or a combination of prose and verse\u2014and offered limited expositions, verses, heartfelt exclamations, quotations, birth stories, extraordinary accounts, and analytical teachings.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, they did not establish training rules or compile a monastic code of conduct. As a result, after these Buddhas and their awakened disciples had passed away, those who joined the spiritual life later lacked proper guidance, leading to its rapid decline.<span id=\"Endnote45\">[<a href=\"#endnote45\">45</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Buddha illustrated this with a simile:</p>\n<p><i>\"It is like scattering flowers on a wooden plank\u2014if they are not tied together with a string, they are easily dispersed, scattered, and carried away by the wind. Why? Because they are not bound together.\"</i></p>\n<h3>Reasons for the Longevity of a Dispensation:</h3>\n<p>The three Buddhas\u2014Kakusandha, Kon\u0101gamana, and Kassapa\u2014provided their disciples with extensive teachings. They delivered numerous discourses in both prose and a mix of prose and verse, including expositions, verses, heartfelt exclamations, quotations, birth stories, extraordinary accounts, and analyses. They also established training rules and recited a monastic code.</p>\n<p>After these Buddhas and their awakened disciples passed away, new followers joined over time, ensuring the longevity of the spiritual path. This continuity can be likened to flowers arranged on a wooden plank: when bound together by a string, they remain secure, neither scattered nor swept away by the wind. Why? Because the string holds them together.</p>\n<h2>Establishing Training Rules in the Sangha</h2>\n<p>Not long after, Venerable S\u0101riputta respectfully said:</p>\n<p><i>\"Venerable Sir, now is the time to establish training rules and recite a monastic code so that this spiritual life may endure for a long time.\" </i><span id=\"Endnote46\">[<a href=\"#endnote46\">46</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Blessed One, with his all-encompassing knowledge and insight, replied:</p>\n<p><i>\"A Teacher does not establish training rules or recite a monastic code until the causes of corruption arise within the Sangha. Only when such causes emerge does the Teacher lay down training rules and recite a monastic code to counteract them.\"</i></p>\n<p>At that time, the Buddha also declared that all five hundred monks residing with him in Vera\u00f1j\u0101 had attained noble status, ranging from stream-enterers to arahants. <span id=\"Endnote47\">[<a href=\"#endnote47\">47</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Famine in Vera\u00f1j\u0101</h2>\n<p>On one occasion, while the Buddha and five hundred monks were spending the rainy season in Vera\u00f1j\u0101, the region was struck by famine. Crops had withered, turning to straw, and food was scarce. Obtaining alms was extremely difficult.</p>\n<p>At that time, five hundred horse merchants from Uttar\u0101patha (the northern region) arrived in Vera\u00f1j\u0101, having paused their journey due to the challenging travel conditions of the rainy season. They witnessed the severe food shortage and noticed that no one was offering alms to the Sangha. Moved by the situation, the merchants decided to donate a portion of barley\u2014a staple grain\u2014to each monk and they brought their offerings to the monastery.</p>\n<p>Understanding the circumstances, Venerable \u0100nanda took the initiative to have the barley pounded and prepared as a porridge, providing sustenance for the Buddha and the five hundred monks residing there.</p>\n<p>Recognizing his timely efforts, the Blessed One praised Venerable \u0100nanda, saying:</p>\n<p><i>\"Well done, \u0100nanda. You are truly noble individuals who have triumphed over the hardships of famine.\u201d</i><span id=\"Endnote48\">[<a href=\"#endnote48\">48</a>]</span><i> </i></p>\n<h3>A Request and the Buddha\u2019s Compassion</h3>\n<p>It is also mentioned that Venerable Moggall\u0101na sought the Buddha\u2019s permission to obtain food from beneath the earth\u2019s surface. However, the compassionate Buddha, who empathized with all living beings, did not approve the request, knowing that such an action would harm the creatures dwelling there.<span id=\"Endnote49\">[<a href=\"#endnote49\">49</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Taking Leave After the Rainy Season</h2>\n<p>After completing the rainy season retreat, the Blessed One addressed Venerable \u0100nanda:</p>\n<p><i>\"\u0100nanda, it is the tradition of Buddhas not to wander the country without first taking leave of</i> <i>those who invited them to stay for the retreat. Let us go to the brahmin of Vera\u00f1j\u0101 and take our leave.\"</i></p>\n<p>Then the Blessed one accompanied by large number of bhikkhus went to see Brahmin Vera\u00f1j\u0101 and said to him:</p>\n<p><i>\u201c Brahmin, we\u2019ve completed the rains residence according to your invitation, and now we take leave of you. We wish to depart to wander the country.\u201d</i></p>\n<p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s true, good Gotama, that you\u2019ve completed the rains residence according to my invitation, but I haven\u2019t given anything. That\u2019s not good. It\u2019s not because I didn\u2019t want to, but because household life is so busy. Would you and the Sangha of monks please accept a meal from me tomorrow?\u201d</i><span id=\"Endnote50\">[<a href=\"#endnote50\">50</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>The Buddha\u2019s Departure from Vera\u00f1j\u0101</h3>\n<p>The Blessed One gave his consent by remaining silent. Accompanied by a large number of bhikkhus, he went to the brahmin\u2019s house and accepted the meal offered to them. After finishing his meal, the brahmin presented the Buddha with a set of three robes and gave each monk two pieces of cloth. In return, the Buddha instructed, inspired, and uplifted him with a teaching. Then, rising from his seat, he departed.</p>\n<p>After staying in Vera\u00f1j\u0101 for as long as he wished, the Buddha set out on his journey, passing through Soreyya, Sa\u1e45kassa, and Ka\u1e47\u1e47akujja before reaching Pay\u0101gapati\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101na. There, he crossed the Ganges River and continued on to Benares. Remaining in Benares for as long as he pleased, he then resumed his travels toward Ves\u0101l\u012b. Upon his arrival, he took residence in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood. <span id=\"Endnote51\">[<a href=\"#endnote51\">51</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>The Buddha\u2019s Journey from Vera\u00f1j\u0101 to Ves\u0101l\u012b After His Twelfth Vassa</h2>\n<p>Based on the above statement from the <i>Vinaya Pitaka</i>, we have used present-day maps to reconstruct the ancient route from Mathura to Prayag, and from there onward to Ves\u0101l\u012b via Varanasi.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>To illustrate this journey, we have provided the following maps.<span id=\"Endnote52\">[<a href=\"#endnote52\">52</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page15_4/image10.png\" />\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>Map A</b>: Atranjki Khera of UP (ancient Vera\u00f1j\u0101) to Etah, UP distance 18.5 km</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page15_4/image11.png\" />\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>Map B</b>: Etah, UP to Soron, UP (ancient Soreyya), distance 46.2 km</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page15_4/image12.png\" />\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>Map C</b>: Soron to Sankisa Basantpur, UP (ancient Sankisa) distance 117.8 km.

Now, we turn our attention to the locations where the Blessed One resided during his thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth <i>vassa</i>, as well as the profound teachings he imparted during this period.</p>\n<h2>Thirteenth Vassa \u2013 On the Serene Heights of Mount C\u0101liya (Age 47)</h2>\n<p>At this stage, the Blessed One was around forty-seven years old\u2014an age often considered the peak of wisdom and experience. He had already spent more than a decade tirelessly teaching, traveling, and establishing the Dhamma for the welfare of both monks and lay followers. According to various sources, the Buddha chose the peaceful heights of Mount C\u0101liya (<i>C\u0101liya Pabbata</i>) as his retreat for the thirteenth rainy season.</p>\n<h3>Scriptural References to the Buddha\u2019s Stay at C\u0101liya</h3>\n<p>The scriptures provide clear evidence of the Buddha\u2019s presence on Mount C\u0101liya:</p>\n<p><b>From the Ud\u0101na (Ud 4.1)</b>:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cThus have I heard: At one time, the Gracious One was dwelling near C\u0101lik\u0101, on the C\u0101lik\u0101 mountain.

The ancient location C\u0101lik\u0101, situated on C\u0101lik\u0101 Mountain, is believed to be associated with Chalika Hill in present-day India. While its exact location is uncertain, some scholars suggest it could be in the eastern region of India, possibly near modern-day Bihar or Jharkhand, where many Buddhist sites are located. One possible identification is Chalika Parvat (Chalika Hill), which may correspond to a smaller hill or mountain in regions historically connected with the Buddha\u2019s travels. <span id=\"Endnote4\">[<a href=\"#endnote4\">4</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b> 2.</b> Renowned Buddhist Scholar Bhikkhu \u0100nandajoti, who has extensively researched the Buddha\u2019s rains retreats, acknowledges the challenge of identifying certain locations. He states:</p>\n<p><b><i>\u201cSome of the places we cannot identify.

However, historical and textual analysis allows us to make some educated guesses:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\t<b>Jantug\u0101ma</b> \u2013 The name suggests it was a significant village (<i>g\u0101ma</i>) during the Buddha\u2019s time, yet it does not frequently appear in major Buddhist texts or inscriptions. Some scholars speculate that it was situated in <b>Magadha or Kosala</b>, but no confirmed identification exists.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\t<b>Kimik\u0101l\u0101 River</b> \u2013 This river is rarely mentioned in Buddhist literature, and its exact location has been lost to history. Some scholars hypothesize that it may have been a tributary of the Ganges, but no conclusive archaeological or textual evidence supports this theory. Some scholars suggest that the Kimikala River was a muddy-water river, possibly originating from these marshlands. The river is believed to have been called Kimikala because it was abundant in black worms (<i>k\u0101lakim\u012bnam bahulat\u0101ya</i>). <span id=\"Endnote6\">[<a href=\"#endnote6\">6</a>]</span></p>\n<p><b>4. Ancient Commentarial Accounts</b></p>\n<p>According to Buddhist commentaries, C\u0101lik\u0101 was both the name of a city and a nearby mountain where the Buddha resided.

Close to C\u0101lika was Jantug\u0101ma, the town where Venerable Meghiya collected alms. Nearby was the Kimik\u0101l\u0101 River, along whose banks lay a mango grove. (<i>A\u1e45guttara Nik\u0101ya 4.354; Ud\u0101na 4.1; Dhammapada Commentary 1.287</i>) <span id=\"Endnote8\">[<a href=\"#endnote8\">8</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>6) <b>The Origin of the Name C\u0101lika</b> \u2013 Ancient sources describe a bog (cala-pa\u1e45ka) surrounding the city, giving it the appearance of being unstable or \u201cmoving,\u201d which is thought to be the origin of its name C\u0101lika (meaning \u2018shaky\u2019 or \u2018unstable\u2019). The White Hill \u2013 A prominent white-coloured hill stood near the town. On dark <i>uposatha</i> (observance) days, it appeared to shift in the moonlight, reinforcing its association with movement (<i>cala</i>). This feature may explain why both the town and the mountain were called C\u0101lika. <span id=\"Endnote9\">[<a href=\"#endnote9\">9</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>7 ) Atop this sacred hill, a large monastery was built through the support of generous donors. It was here that the Buddha spent his thirteenth vassa, in peaceful seclusion, imparting wisdom to those who sought his guidance. <span id=\"Endnote10\">[<a href=\"#endnote10\">10</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Possible Location of the Ancient Chalika Hills</h3>\n<p>Based on the above information, it can be concluded that the village or town of Chalika was situated <b>near a vast marshy area of Ganges River Basin.</b>  Could the Ancient Chalika Hills be in Bihar-Jharkhand?</p>\n<p>According to the above facts, it is possible that the ancient Chalika Hills was located in the Bihar-Jharkhand region. Geographically, this area is characterized by hilly terrain, lush forests, and diverse wildlife, including elephants and tigers. The region experiences heavy monsoon rainfall, which likely results in boggy and marshy landscapes.</p>\n<p>Ancient sources describe a bog (cala-pa\u1e45ka) surrounding the city, giving it an appearance of instability or movement. This is believed to be the origin of its name, C\u0101lika, which means \"shaky\" or \"unstable.\" Additionally, historical accounts mention a prominent white-colored hill near the town/village. On dark uposatha (observance) days, it appeared to shift in the moonlight, further reinforcing the association with movement <b>(</b>cala)<b>. </b>This unique feature may explain why both the town and the mountain were called C\u0101lika.<span id=\"Endnote11\">[<a href=\"#endnote11\">11</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Furthermore, Jharkhand, located in eastern India, is renowned for its geographical diversity. It is bordered by Bihar to the north, Uttar Pradesh and Chhattisgarh to the west, Odisha to the south, and West Bengal to the east, serving as a crucial link between northern and southern India. Spanning approximately 79,714 square kilometres, Jharkhand's landscape includes rolling hills, mineral-rich plateaus, and dense forests. The state's name, <b>\"</b>Jharkhand\", meaning <b><i>\"land of forests,</i></b><i>\"</i> reflects its extensive woodland cover, which accounts for about 29% of its total area. Several rivers flow through the state, supporting agriculture and sustaining the local population.<span id=\"Endnote12\">[<a href=\"#endnote12\">12</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Given these geographical features\u2014hilly landscapes, dense forests, monsoon-fed wetlands, and historical descriptions of an unstable or shifting terrain\u2014Jharkhand presents a compelling case as a potential location for the ancient Chalika Hills.</p>\n<p>The exact location of Chalika Hills, where the Buddha spent three vassas (rainy seasons), remains uncertain due to limited historical references. However, the <b>Gautam Buddha Wildlife Sanctuary</b> in the Bihar-Jharkhand region presents a compelling site for exploration, as its geographical features closely resemble those described in historical accounts.</p>\n<h4><i>The possibilities:</i></h4>\n<p><b>1. Gautam Buddha Wildlife Sanctuary and Chalika Hills</b></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\t<b>Location:</b> <b>The Gautam Buddha Wildlife Sanctuary</b> is located in <b>Gaya (Bihar) and Koderma (Jharkhand)</b> districts. (see the maps below)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\t<b>Historical Significance:</b> While this region is named after the Buddha, the exact reason for this naming is unclear. It could be due to historical connections, traditional beliefs, or even later naming conventions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\t<b>Geography:</b> The sanctuary consists of <b>low hills and forests</b>, which could match descriptions of a retreat-like place for monastic practice.</p>\n<p><b>2.

However, ancient sources do not precisely locate it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\tSome scholars have suggested Chalika Hills locations in <b>Bihar/Jharkhand</b> due to the Buddha\u2019s frequent travels in Magadha and Anga regions.</p>\n<p><b>3.

While the Buddha was often surrounded by a large retinue of monks, journeying from place to place for the benefit of the lay community and to provide his disciples with opportunities for solitude, there were moments when he chose seclusion himself. Perhaps, as one who always emphasized solitude as essential for spiritual growth, the Buddha wished to spend his thirteenth rainy season away from the hustle and bustle of cities and towns, finding refuge in the serene beauty of this remote natural setting.</p>\n<p>The fact that he later spent two more rainy seasons\u2014the 18th and 19th\u2014at the very same Chalika Hills further supports this idea. Could it be that the All-Compassionate One, perceiving that his devoted attendant, Venerable Meghiya, was ready for a profound transformation, chose this retreat to grant him the opportunity to deepen his practice and attain noble realizations?</p>\n<p>Thus, the Buddha\u2019s retreat on Mount C\u0101liya was not only a time of seclusion but also a period of deep teaching\u2014guiding disciples in the cultivation of insight, patience, and wisdom.</p>\n<h3>Advice to Venerable Meghiya</h3>\n<p>While the exact teachings given during this <i>vassa</i> are not fully detailed in the texts, the presence of Venerable Meghiya as the Buddha\u2019s attendant suggests that this period included significant instructions on mental cultivation and solitude. The Meghiya Sutta (Ud 4.1) highlights a crucial lesson:</p>\n<p>One day, while collecting alms in the village of Jantu, Venerable Meghiya came upon a mango grove near the Kimikala River. Struck by its serene atmosphere, he felt it would be an ideal place for meditation. Eager to cultivate his practice, he approached the Blessed One and requested permission to go there. <span id=\"Endnote20\">[<a href=\"#endnote20\">20</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Buddha gently advised him:</p>\n<p><i>\"Meghiya, since we are alone, wait until another bhikkhu arrives.\"</i></p>\n<p>However, Venerable Meghiya respectfully insisted:</p>\n<p><i>\"Bhante, for the Blessed One, there is nothing more to be done, nor anything left to perfect. But for me, there is still work to be done and progress to be made.\"</i></p>\n<p>After making his request three times, the Buddha finally said:</p>\n<p><b>\"</b><i>Since you are so determined to strive, Meghiya, what can I say? You may go at your own convenience.\"</i></p>\n<p>With great enthusiasm, Venerable Meghiya set off for the mango grove. However, as he sat in meditation, his mind became restless, struggling to remain focused. Instead of attaining deep Sam\u0101dhi, he was overwhelmed by a flood of unwholesome thoughts\u2014sensual desire, aversion, and cruelty. <span id=\"Endnote21\">[<a href=\"#endnote21\">21</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Disheartened, he returned to the Buddha and humbly shared his experience. With boundless compassion, the Blessed One expounded the essential qualities that support meditation, guiding him toward the path of true liberation. The Buddha gently reminded him that true spiritual growth requires <b>mature wisdom, the right conditions, and the support of good companions </b>(<i>kaly\u0101\u1e47amitta</i>). This teaching reinforces an essential principle in the Dhamma:</p>\n<p>Wisdom does not arise merely through solitude, but through the careful development of virtue, reflection, and the guidance of the wise.</p>\n<h4><i>Essential Factors That Support Meditation</i></h4>\n<p>The Blessed One, in his boundless compassion, illuminated the path for the devoted disciple Meghiya, revealing the essential factors that lead to the ripening of liberation. He declared:</p>\n<p><i>\"Meghiya, when the liberation of the mind has not yet matured, there are five factors that lead to its fulfillment. What are these five?\"</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1)\tKaly\u0101\u1e47amittat\u0101 \u2013 The Blessing of Noble Friendship</p>\n<p>A bhikkhu flourishes in the company of wise and virtuous Dhamma friends, whose presence nurtures his resolve and strengthens his practice.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2)\tS\u012bla \u2013 The Foundation of Virtue</p>\n<p>He abides in purity, upholding the P\u0101timokkha discipline with unwavering commitment, guarding his conduct with mindfulness and restraint.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>3)\tDhamma-savana \u2013 The Nourishment of the Mind</p>\n<p>He listens to and reflects upon the sublime teachings\u2014discourses that inspire renunciation, contentment, solitude, detachment, diligence, virtue, concentration, wisdom, liberation, and the direct realization of truth.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>4)\tViriya \u2013 The Unyielding Effort</p>\n<p>With resolute energy, he diligently abandons unwholesome qualities and cultivates wholesome states, steadfast in his duty to perfect virtue and wisdom.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>5)\tPa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101 \u2013 The Penetrating Wisdom</p>\n<p>He discerns with clarity the arising and passing of all phenomena, possessing wisdom that is noble, profound, and leads to the complete cessation of suffering.</p>\n<h4><i>The Further Four Factors</i></h4>\n<p>Having firmly established himself in these five qualities, the earnest bhikkhu further cultivates four essential meditative perceptions:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>6)\tThe Perception of Unattractiveness (Asubha-sa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101) \u2013 To transcend the grip of lust, he contemplates the true nature of the body, perceiving its impermanent and conditioned nature.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>7)\tLoving-Kindness (Mett\u0101-bh\u0101van\u0101) \u2013 To dissolve the flames of ill-will, he radiates boundless loving-kindness, embracing all beings with compassion and goodwill.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>8)\tMindfulness of Breathing (\u0100n\u0101p\u0101nasati) \u2013 To quell the restless wanderings of the mind, he anchors himself in the breath, cultivating deep tranquility and unwavering focus.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>9)\tThe Perception of Impermanence (Anicca-sa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101) \u2013 To uproot the conceit of \u2018I am,\u2019 he contemplates the transient nature of all things. With the stabilization of this perception, the realization of non-self (anatt\u0101) deepens, culminating in the direct experience of Nibb\u0101na\u2014the ultimate freedom, here and now. <span id=\"Endnote22\">[<a href=\"#endnote22\">22</a>]</span></p>\n<h4><i>The Awakened Realization</i></h4>\n<p>Shortly after imparting this sublime discourse to Venerable Meghiya, the Buddha uttered the following exalted verses (Ud\u0101na): <span id=\"Endnote23\">[<a href=\"#endnote23\">23</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\"There are low thoughts, fine thoughts,</i></p>\n<p><i>Together with elation in the mind,</i></p>\n<p><i>Not having understood these thoughts of the mind,</i></p>\n<p><i>The unsteady mind runs here and there.</i></p>\n<p><i>Having understood these thoughts of the mind,</i></p>\n<p><i>He who is ardent, mindful, restrains them.</i></p>\n<p><i>Also elations that have not arisen in the mind\u2014</i></p>\n<p><i>An Awakened One has given these up completely.\"</i></p>\n<h4><i>The Triumph of Venerable Meghiya</i></h4>\n<p>In due course, Venerable Meghiya, recognizing the weight of his initial heedlessness, surrendered himself completely to the Blessed One\u2019s guidance. As an obedient disciple, he cultivated the path with unwavering faith and diligence. His perseverance bore fruit, and he ultimately attained the highest goal\u2014Arahantship. His own words in the Therag\u0101th\u0101 resound with the victory of final liberation:</p>\n<p><i>\"He counselled me, the great hero,</i></p>\n<p><i>The one who has gone beyond all things.</i></p>\n<p><i>Upon hearing his teaching,</i></p>\n<p><i>I remained close to him, ever mindful.</i></p>\n<p><i>I have attained the threefold knowledge</i></p>\n<p><i>And perfectly fulfilled the Buddha\u2019s instructions.\" </i><span id=\"Endnote24\">[<a href=\"#endnote24\">24</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Thus, the journey of Meghiya stands as a beacon for all who seek the path\u2014an unwavering testament that, with the right conditions and steadfast effort, the heart\u2019s liberation is within reach.</p>\n<p>With that inspiring event we will conclude the thirteenth vassa.</p>\n<h1>Fourteenth Vassa at age 48</h1>\n<p>Tradition says that the Buddha completing the thirteenth rainy season at C\u0101lika Hills set out from there, eventually arrived at Jetavana monastery at S\u0101vatth\u012b   He spends the fourteenth vassa there amidst of large Sangha community and lay followers in the famous Jetavana Monastery.</p>\n<h4><i>The following sources also confirm this:</i></h4>\n<p>1) The fourteenth in the Jeta\u2019s Wood great Monastery (near S\u0101vatth\u012b)</p>\n<p><i>( cuddasama\u1e41 Jetavanamah\u0101vih\u0101re ). </i><span id=\"Endnote25\">[<a href=\"#endnote25\">25</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2) The Master of the Dhamma, whose delightful hands and feet were like Bandhuka flowers, devoted to the welfare of all beings \u2014 the Hero, the Sage of Great Power \u2014 in the fourteenth Rains Retreat, dwelt in the very delightful and excellent Jeta\u2019s Wood.

It was in this thriving city that the Buddha spent a considerable amount of time, teaching, guiding, and establishing the early community of monks and lay followers. S\u0101vatth\u012b, with its serene surroundings and spiritual energy, became a vibrant centre for the Dhamma.</p>\n<p>The city is particularly famous for the Jetavana Monastery, gifted to the Buddha by the wealthy merchant An\u0101thapi\u1e47\u1e0dika. This monastery became the Buddha's primary residence for many years and a place where many key teachings were delivered, including some of the most profound discourses. It is where the Buddha taught his followers the deeper truths of life, such as the Four Noble Truths, the Eightfold Path, and countless other principles that have shaped Buddhist practice ever since.</p>\n<p>S\u0101vatth\u012b's importance lies not only in its physical presence but in its role as the heart of spiritual transformation. It was a place of refuge, where beings from all walks of life could seek solace, wisdom, and a path to liberation. For Buddhists, it is a symbol of spiritual growth and the potential for enlightenment that can arise in a supportive community.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page16_1/image90.png\" />Today, the legacy of S\u0101vatth\u012b endures, reminding us that just as the Buddha found a place to spread his wisdom, we too can cultivate spaces in our lives where the teachings of the Dhamma can flourish, transforming our minds and hearts toward peace, compassion, and understanding. S\u0101vatth\u012b represents the flourishing of wisdom, where each step towards liberation is taken with intention, kindness, and the pursuit of true insight into the nature of suffering and its cessation.\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page16_1/image8.jpeg\" />\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>Location of S\u0101vatth\u012b</b><b> </b><b>in Ancient India </b><span id=\"Endnote28\">[<a href=\"#endnote28\">28</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page16_1/image9.jpeg\" />\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>Location of S\u0101vatth\u012b</b><b> </b><b>in Modern India </b><span id=\"Endnote29\">[<a href=\"#endnote29\">29</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page16_1/image10.jpeg\" />\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>Ruins of S\u0101vtth</b>i <span id=\"Endnote30\">[<a href=\"#endnote30\">30</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Profound Dhamma Teachings of this Period</h2>\n<h3>The Buddha\u2019s Timeless Advice to Venerable R\u0101hula</h3>\n<p>According to tradition, this illuminating discourse was delivered to Venerable R\u0101hula when he was around eighteen years old, guiding him away from the entanglements of worldly desire and towards the path of true renunciation. <span id=\"Endnote31\">[<a href=\"#endnote31\">31</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>On one occasion as R\u0101hula followed the Blessed One on his alms round, his heart swelled with admiration for the Buddha\u2019s radiant presence. Seeing the perfect form of his father, he reflected,</p>\n<p><b>\u201cI too am handsome like the Buddha. His form is beautiful, and so is mine.\u201d</b></p>\n<p>Perceiving his son\u2019s thoughts with boundless wisdom and compassion, the Buddha knew that unchecked vanity could become a subtle but perilous snare. Wishing to free R\u0101hula from the illusion of self and attachment to the body, he spoke a profound teaching\u2014guiding him to see beyond fleeting appearances and to realize that the body is neither a self nor a possession of self. Thus, with gentle yet piercing words, the Buddha illuminated the path of wisdom, leading R\u0101hula towards deeper insight and liberation.</p>\n<p><b>The Essence of the Buddha\u2019s Profound Counsel:</b><span id=\"Endnote32\">[<a href=\"#endnote32\">32</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Blessed One imparted a timeless truth to Venerable R\u0101hula, urging him to see with the eye of wisdom:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cAll forms\u2014whether past, future, or present; internal or external; gross or subtle; inferior or superior; far or near\u2014must be understood as they truly are: \u2018This is not mine, this I am not, this is not myself.\u2019\u201d</i></p>\n<p>Hearing this piercing wisdom, Venerable R\u0101hula was deeply moved. He thought to himself, <i>\u201cHow could I go into the town for alms today, having been personally admonished by the Blessed One?\u201d</i></p>\n<p>With a heart stirred towards deeper reflection, he turned back, seeking solitude beneath a tree. There, in quiet contemplation, he immersed himself in the Buddha\u2019s words, allowing the light of insight to dispel the shadows of delusion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Meditation on the Elements<b> </b><span id=\"Endnote33\">[<a href=\"#endnote33\">33</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As evening fell, Venerable R\u0101hula approached the Buddha once more. To free him from attachment to the body, the Blessed One offered a profound teaching on the egoless nature of material form.</p>\n<p>An ordinary person, untrained in the Dhamma, clings to the body as <b>\u201cmine\u201d</b> and mistakenly perceives it as a self. But the Buddha revealed that what we call the body is, in truth, nothing more than a composition of the four great elements\u2014earth, water, fire, and wind.</p>\n<p>He explained these elements in terms of their physical characteristics and functions:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\t<b>Earth element (pa\u1e6dhavi-dh\u0101tu):</b> The foundation and structural support.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\t<b>Water element (\u0101po-dh\u0101tu):</b> The cohesive force that binds matter together.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\t<b>Fire element (tejo-dh\u0101tu):</b> The transformative force responsible for maturation and temperature.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\t<b>Wind element (v\u0101yo-dh\u0101tu):</b> The movement and expansion within all physical forms.</p>\n<p>The <b>earth element</b>, for instance, exists both internally and externally. Internally, it manifests as the solid components of the body\u2014head hair, body hair, nails, teeth, skin, and all thirty-one bodily parts. Externally, it appears in the world around us, in the earth and all solid structures. In essence, there is no difference between the two; both are simply matter, devoid of self.</p>\n<p><b>Water Element (\u0100po-dh\u0101tu)</b></p>\n<p>The water element exists in two forms: internal and external.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\t<b>Internal water element</b> refers to the fluids within the body, such as blood, tears, urine, and other bodily liquids.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\t<b>External water element</b> includes all sources of water outside the body, such as rain, rivers, lakes, and oceans.</p>\n<p>Despite their distinction, both are simply manifestations of the water element, without any inherent self.</p>\n<p><b>Fire Element (Tejo-dh\u0101tu)</b></p>\n<p>The fire element also has internal and external aspects.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\t<b>Internal fire element</b> is the heat within the body, responsible for warmth, digestion, and the aging process.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\t<b>External fire element</b> includes sources of heat and combustion outside the body, such as sunlight, flames, and other sources of warmth.</p>\n<p>Though they appear different, both are expressions of the same fiery nature.</p>\n<p><b>Air Element (V\u0101yo-dh\u0101tu)</b></p>\n<p>The air element is present both internally and externally.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\t<b>Internal air element</b> consists of movements of air within the body, such as inhalation, exhalation, upward-moving and downward-moving winds, and other bodily airs.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\t<b>External air element</b> manifests as the wind, breezes, storms, and cyclones in the natural world.</p>\n<p>Both forms are simply the movement of air, without true ownership or self.</p>\n<p><b>Space Element (\u0100k\u0101sa-dh\u0101tu)</b></p>\n<p>Though not considered a primary element, the Buddha taught about the space element as a derivative form of materiality, existing both within and outside the body.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\t<b>Internal space element</b> refers to the empty spaces within the body, such as the ear canals, nostrils, and other hollow cavities.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\t<b>External space element</b> includes the vast sky, the gaps between objects, and all open spaces in the external world.</p>\n<p>Both are merely manifestations of emptiness, neither belonging to nor defining any self.</p>\n<h4><i>Seeing Reality as It Truly Is</i></h4>\n<p>The essence of understanding the elements is to perceive their true nature\u2014there is nothing within them that can rightfully be called \"me,\" \"mine,\" or \"myself.\" They are simply natural processes, existing both within and beyond the body, without ownership or selfhood.</p>\n<p>The Buddha declared:</p>\n<p><i>\"These elements must be seen as they truly are, with proper wisdom: \u2018This is not mine, this I am not, this is not myself.\u2019</i>\"</p>\n<p>When one contemplates them in this way, wisdom arises, dispelling the illusion of self. One sees that the body is nothing more than a temporary collection of elements, bound together for a time, only to disperse again. Realizing this truth, the heart becomes disenchanted, and from disenchantment arises a deep sense of detachment. The mind, no longer bound by craving, grows serene and unshaken.</p>\n<p>To strengthen this impartial understanding, the Buddha encouraged Venerable R\u0101hula to meditate on the four elements with equanimity. In addition, he taught him the sublime practices of the Four Brahmavih\u0101ras\u2014loving-kindness, compassion, altruistic joy, and equanimity\u2014as well as the profound meditation on mindfulness of breathing (\u0100n\u0101p\u0101nasati).</p>\n<p>Thus, the Blessed One imparted his teaching, and Venerable R\u0101hula, deeply inspired, rejoiced in his father\u2019s words. With unwavering diligence, he put the Dhamma into practice, walking the path with ardour and sincerity.</p>\n<p>In the sections that follow, we shall see how his perseverance led him to the ultimate realization\u2014Arahantship, the complete liberation of the mind.</p>\n<h1>Fifteenth Vassa at age 49</h1>\n<p>According to tradition the Buddha having spent his fourteenth vassa in S\u0101vtthi, delivering many discourses for the welfare of Sangha community as well as lay people walked towards his home town in Kapilavattu to spend the fifteenth rainy season there. He arrived in the city with a large number of Sangha and stayed at Nigrodh\u0101r\u0101ma forest monastery. In section 14.2 of this series, we described Buddha\u2019s first visit to Kapilavattu after his enlightenment. On that occasion Prince Nigrodh\u0101 donated this monastery in the great wood of Sakyan republic to the Buddha and the Sangha.</p>\n<p>According to various sources, the Blessed One spent his fifteenth rainy season in Kapilavattu of the Sakyan republic.</p>\n<p>1) The fifteenth near the great city of Kapilavatthu (at the Nigrodh\u0101r\u0101ma, near his home town, amongst the S\u0101kiyans (<i>pa\u00f1cadasama\u1e41 Kapilavatthumah\u0101nagare) </i><span id=\"Endnote34\">[<a href=\"#endnote34\">34</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2) The Lion King of Sages, having slain the forest of elephant-like passion in his responsive relatives, in the fifteenth Rains Retreat, dwelt in the delightful Jewel Cave in Nigrodha\u2019s Monastery, on a broad mountain near Kapilavatthu<i>.(</i><i> </i><i>Muni-S\u012bha-R\u0101j\u0101, veneyya-bandhu-vana-r\u0101ga-gaje vihantv\u0101, pa\u00f1cadasame Vassamhi, Kapilavatthu-dhar\u0101dhara-uru-Nigrodha-\u0100r\u0101ma-rama\u1e47\u012bya-Ma\u1e47i-Guh\u0101ya\u1e41 v\u0101sa\u1e41 ak\u0101).</i><span id=\"Endnote35\">[<a href=\"#endnote35\">35</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>3) After staying in S\u0101vatth\u012b for the fourteenth vassa, remained in that city, after the end of the vassa for as long as there were beings worthy of teaching. Thereafter, he set out to administer the medicinal Dhamma teachings to all beings, and eventually arrived in the city of Kapilavattu together with a host of monks, and observed the fifteenth vassa at Nigrodh\u0101r\u0101ma. <span id=\"Endnote36\">[<a href=\"#endnote36\">36</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>At this time of his visit his father King Suddhodhana has passed away as an arahant, his foster mother became the first bhikkhuni to ordain under the Buddha, and his step brother and sister Nanda Gotama and Nand\u0101 Gotami as well as his former wife Princess Yasodhara, his son Rahula all became disciples of the Buddha. Therefore, the Buddha had not his immediate family to welcome him.  But he had many other Sakyans as his lay followers. One of them was Mah\u0101nama Sakyan, the elder brother of Venerable Anuruddha.

Although the suttas themselves do not explicitly mention that these teachings were given during the Buddha\u2019s fifteenth vassa (rainy retreat), the Buddhist tradition affirms this, leading us to assume that the following discourses were delivered during that period.</p>\n<h4><i>The Destiny of One Who Lives According to the Dhamma </i><span id=\"Endnote40\">[<a href=\"#endnote40\">40</a>]</span></h4>\n<p>On one occasion, Mah\u0101n\u0101ma approached the Blessed One with a deep concern weighing upon his heart. He said:</p>\n<p><i>\"Bhante, when I enter Kapilavatthu in the evening, I sometimes encounter a stray elephant, a stray horse, a stray chariot, or a stray cart. At such moments, my mindfulness of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha becomes unsettled. If I were to die at that very moment, what would be my fate? What would be my future rebirth?\"</i></p>\n<p>Sensing Mah\u0101n\u0101ma\u2019s apprehension, the Buddha, full of compassion and wisdom, reassured him:</p>\n<p><i>\"Do not fear, Mah\u0101n\u0101ma! Your passing will not be an unfortunate one. When a person\u2019s mind has been strengthened over a long time by faith, virtue, learning, generosity, and wisdom, even if his body is left to be consumed by crows, vultures, or other creatures, his mind\u2014cultivated and purified by these noble qualities\u2014will ascend to a higher destination, to distinction.\"</i></p>\n<p>To further illustrate this truth, the Blessed One offered two compelling similes:</p>\n<p><b>The Simile of the Ghee Pot</b></p>\n<p><i>\"Suppose a man were to submerge a pot filled with ghee in a deep pool of water and then break it. The fragments of the pot would sink downward, but the ghee or oil inside would naturally rise to the surface. Likewise, when a person\u2019s mind has been fortified for a long time by faith, virtue, learning, generosity, and wisdom, it does not descend; rather, it rises towards a higher realm.\" </i><span id=\"Endnote41\">[<a href=\"#endnote41\">41</a>]</span><i> </i></p>\n<p><b>The Simile of the Tree</b></p>\n<p><i>\"Consider a tree that leans and inclines towards the east. If it were cut at its root, it would naturally fall in the direction it was already leaning. In the same way, when a noble disciple possesses four essential qualities\u2014confidence in the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha, along with perfect virtue\u2014his inclination is towards Nibb\u0101na. Even at the time of death, his mind will move in that direction.\" </i><span id=\"Endnote42\">[<a href=\"#endnote42\">42</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>With these insightful words, the Blessed One dispelled Mah\u0101n\u0101ma\u2019s doubts, replacing his fear with clarity and joy. His compassionate teachings once again affirmed the unwavering truth: <b>one who diligently cultivates the Dhamma is never lost but is steadily carried towards liberation.</b></p>\n<h3>The Definition of a Lay Follower </h3>\n<p>In this discourse, the Buddha explained to Mah\u0101n\u0101ma the Sakyan who truly qualifies as a lay follower (up\u0101saka for a male lay disciple, up\u0101sik\u0101 for a female lay disciple). A lay follower is not merely one who identifies with the Buddha\u2019s teachings but one who embodies certain essential qualities. The Blessed One outlined five defining characteristics: <span id=\"Endnote43\">[<a href=\"#endnote43\">43</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1)\tTaking Refuge in the Triple Gem \u2013 A lay follower is one who has sincerely taken refuge in the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha, recognizing them as the supreme guides on the path to liberation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2)\tLiving by Virtue \u2013 One who is established in moral discipline by upholding the five precepts: abstaining from killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, false speech, and intoxicants that cloud the mind. This ethical foundation ensures purity of conduct and harmony in life.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>3)\tFaith in the Buddha and His Teachings \u2013 A true lay disciple possesses unwavering confidence in the Buddha\u2019s enlightenment and the truth of his teachings. This faith is not blind belief but an informed trust rooted in understanding and experience.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>4)\tGenerosity and a Joyful Heart in Giving \u2013 A lay follower is devoted to acts of charity, delighting in giving and sharing with others. This quality of generosity (d\u0101na) fosters selflessness and accumulates great merit, leading to inner joy and spiritual progress.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>5)\tPossession of Wisdom \u2013 True wisdom is not mere intellectual knowledge but deep insight into the nature of reality\u2014seeing the arising and passing away of all phenomena. This wisdom is noble and penetrative, ultimately leading to the complete cessation of suffering.</p>\n<p>Thus, a lay follower is not defined by mere affiliation but by the cultivation of these five qualities. Through faith, virtue, generosity, and wisdom, a lay disciple walks steadily on the path towards liberation, progressing in the Dhamma with a heart full of confidence and joy.</p>\n<h2>Other Events Happened During this Period</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>Buddha\u2019s encounter with Suppabuddha the Sakyan<b> </b><span id=\"Endnote44\">[<a href=\"#endnote44\">44</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>According to tradition while the Buddha was residing Nigrodh\u0101r\u0101ma nearby the city of Kapilvattu, Suppabuddha the S\u0101kiyan who was the Buddha\u2019s father-in-law obstructed the Buddha and the Sangha on their way to alms-round in the city.</p>\n<p>It seems he was angry with the Buddha for two reasons: his daughter was Princess Yasodhara, and he was angry with the Buddha because as Prince Siddhartha went away from the palace leaving Princess Yasodhara for an ascetic life; the second reason was Venerable Devadatta was his son and he thought the Buddha has not treated him properly.</p>\n<p>So, on one occasion when the Buddha was coming for almas in the city, he blocked the path and the Buddha his compassionate ways did not by pass him but turned away.</p>\n<p>As the Buddha returned on his way, he smiled.

There, he delivered numerous profound Dhamma teachings, benefiting both the Sangha and the lay community.

They realized that, from that moment onward, their land would no longer be darkened by the horrors of human sacrifice. Fear melted away, and the promise of a life free from distress and violence dawned upon them. As they listened to the Buddha\u2019s sublime discourse, wisdom arose in their hearts, and by the time his words had settled, eighty-four thousand among them had entered the path of liberation, attaining the first noble stage\u2014stream-entry.

The Buddha not only tamed the Yakka, \u0100\u1e37avaka, but also established him in the Dhamma, transforming a once-terrifying being into a force of peace.</p>\n<p>According to tradition, countless thousands in \u0100\u1e37av\u012b rejoiced and took refuge in the Buddha, and from then on, Buddhism flourished in the land. Prince \u0100\u1e37av\u012b, also known as Hatthaka of \u0100\u1e37avaka, was raised in this environment of wisdom and virtue. Unlike many princes whose lives are often marked by indulgence and reckless company, he grew up surrounded by the teachings of the Buddha. As a result, he remained free from the taint of unwholesome deeds and bad associations, his life guided by the light of the Dhamma.</p>\n<h3>The Story Behind the Name \"Hatthaka of \u0100\u1e37avaka\"</h3>\n<p>Legend provides a fascinating account of how the prince came to be known as Hatthaka. It is said that when the Buddha tamed the fierce Yakka, the royal guards from King \u0100\u1e37av\u012b\u2019s palace, unaware of the transformation, arrived at the scene with the infant prince\u2014offering him as a sacrifice. However, the now gentle and subdued Yakka, filled with newfound kindness, took the child into his hands with great care and then placed him in the hands of the Blessed One.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Buddha, the embodiment of boundless compassion, held the prince and blessed him. In return, he handed the child back to the royal guards, who then carried him to the palace. The king, overcome with relief and gratitude upon seeing his son safe from a cruel death, joyfully placed him in the arms of the queen, who was still weeping over her beloved child. Since the infant had passed through so many hands\u2014those of the Yakka, the Buddha, the royal guards, the king, and the queen\u2014he was thereafter called \"Hatthaka,\" meaning \"one who has passed through many hands.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Prince Hatthaka\u2019s Encounter with the Buddha<b> </b><span id=\"Endnote26\">[<a href=\"#endnote26\">26</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Years later, as a young man, Hatthaka encountered the Blessed One again.

As Hatthaka wandered for exercise, he noticed the Buddha sitting there, serene and composed. Approaching with deep reverence, he paid homage and respectfully took a seat to one side.</p>\n<p>Looking at the Buddha, Hatthaka asked,<i> </i><b><i>\"Bhante, did the Blessed One sleep well?\"</i></b></p>\n<p>The Buddha, ever radiant and at peace, replied, <b>\"</b><b><i>Yes, prince, I slept well.

Therefore, remember Hatthaka of \u0100\u1e37av\u012b as one who possesses </i><b><i>an eighth extraordinary and admirable quality\u2014fewness of desires</i></b><i>.\u201d</i></p>\n<h2>The Power of Virtuous Leadership</h2>\n<p>On another occasion, Prince Hatthaka of \u0100\u1e37av\u012b, accompanied by five hundred devoted lay followers, approached the Buddha and paid homage. The Blessed One then asked him: <span id=\"Endnote29\">[<a href=\"#endnote29\">29</a>]</span></p>\n<p>\u201cHatthaka, your retinue is vast. By what means do you sustain such a following?\u201d</p>\n<p>The prince humbly replied:</p>\n<p>Bhante, I follow the four principles of harmonious relationships (sa\u1e45gaha-vatthu) taught by the Blessed One:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1)\tIf a person is to be sustained by generosity, I offer gifts.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2)\tIf a person is to be sustained by kind and endearing speech, I speak with warmth and affection.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>3)\tIf a person is to be sustained by acts of service, I assist them through beneficial conduct.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>4)\tIf a person is to be sustained by impartiality, I treat them equitably, sharing in their joys and sorrows.\u201d</p>\n<p>He continued, \u201cBhante, there is wealth in my family, and my followers do not see me as one who is destitute and powerless. Because of this, they listen to my counsel, follow my advice, and do not disregard my guidance.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hearing this, the Buddha praised the prince and expounded further:</p>\n<p>\u201cExcellent, Hatthaka! This is indeed the way to sustain a great following. In the past, those who upheld large retinues did so by these same four principles. In the future, those who cultivate devoted assemblies will do so by these same four principles. Even now, those who gather and sustain a great following do so by these same four principles.\u201d</p>\n<p>Then the Blessed One recited these verses:</p>\n<h3>The Four Pillars of Harmonious Relationships</h3>\n<p>Through generosity, kind speech,</p>\n<p>Beneficial conduct, and impartiality,</p>\n<p>Under diverse worldly conditions,</p>\n<p>As is fitting for each circumstance\u2014</p>\n<p>These noble principles</p>\n<p>Are the linchpin of a moving chariot. <span id=\"Endnote30\">[<a href=\"#endnote30\">30</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Without these pillars of harmony,</p>\n<p>Even parents would fail to earn</p>\n<p>The love and respect of their children.</p>\n<p>Yet, because these principles exist,</p>\n<p>The wise uphold them with reverence.</p>\n<p>Through them, they rise to greatness,</p>\n<p>Adorned with the highest praise.</p>\n<h3>Thus, the Blessed One revealed the wisdom of skilful association:</h3>\n<p>Some are won over by generosity, so give to them. Others are moved by kind words, so speak gently to them. Some require guidance in wholesome conduct, so advise them wisely: \u201cThis is beneficial, this is not. Associate with this one, not with that one.\u201d And some need the reassurance of companionship, so share in their joys and sorrows\u2014sit with them, eat with them, and foster a spirit of unity.  This, bhikkhus, is how the wise sustain meaningful relationships and inspire others to walk the path of virtue.<span id=\"Endnote31\">[<a href=\"#endnote31\">31</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Spiritual Journey of Prince Hatthaka of \u0100\u1e37av\u012b</p>\n<p><i>A Model Lay Follower</i></p>\n<p>The path to true happiness, both in this life and in future lives, is illuminated by those who walk steadfastly in the Dhamma.

Just as Hatthaka cultivated faith, virtue, and wisdom, we too must earnestly strive to deepen our practice, so that when the time of departure arrives, we may go forth, insatiable in our love for the Dhamma, and destined for ever greater awakening.</p>\n<p>May we all take refuge in the Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha, walking the path with joy and determination, never growing weary of seeing the noble ones, hearing the good Dhamma, and serving the community of the wise!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page16_2/image7.jpeg\" />\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>The young daughter of the village weaver paying attention to the teaching of the Buddha </b><span id=\"Endnote36\">[<a href=\"#endnote36\">36</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Story of the Weaver\u2019s Daughter</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Although the scriptures do not explicitly record this story, the commentaries and tradition recount a remarkable event that took place when the Blessed One was residing at the Agg\u0101\u1e37ava Shrine in \u0100\u1e37av\u012b. <span id=\"Endnote37\">[<a href=\"#endnote37\">37</a>]</span> It is said that during his stay, a young weaver\u2019s daughter from \u0100\u1e37av\u012b attained stream-entry after hearing his profound teaching. Since this occurred in \u0100\u1e37av\u012b, we include it here to highlight the Buddha\u2019s boundless compassion and his appreciation for those who truly understood the Dhamma, regardless of their age or social status.</p>\n<h3>The story unfolds as follows:</h3>\n<p>On one occasion, while staying in \u0100\u1e37av\u012b, the Buddha delivered a discourse on the contemplation of death (mara\u1e47asati). With great clarity, he urged his listeners to reflect deeply on the fleeting nature of life, saying:</p>\n<p><b>\u201cPractice mindfulness of death, reminding yourselves:</p>\n<p></b>\u2018<b>My life is uncertain; my death is certain.</p>\n<p>My death is inevitable; life will surely end in death.</p>\n<p>Life is utterly uncertain; death is absolutely certain...\u2019</p>\n<p></b></p>\n<p>But those who cultivate this contemplation will have no fear when their final moment arrives.</p>\n<p>Like a steadfast man who, upon spotting a serpent from afar, swiftly lifts it with a stick and casts it away, so too will the wise cast away fear and face death with unshaken serenity.</p>\n<p>Therefore, practice meditation on death.\u201d</p>\n<p>Among those gathered to hear these words was a sixteen-year-old girl from a nearby village\u2014the daughter of a humble weaver. Though young in years, her heart was deeply stirred by the Buddha\u2019s teaching. The truth of life\u2019s uncertainty and the inevitability of death resonated within her, awakening a profound understanding.</p>\n<p>From that day onward, she never let this contemplation fade. Whether attending to household tasks or assisting her father at the loom, she remained mindful of impermanence. <b>Weaving threads of fabric by day and weaving threads of wisdom by night</b>, she lived with the awareness that each breath, each moment, was a step closer to life\u2019s end. Yet, far from despairing, this insight deepened her clarity, her peace, and her devotion to the Dhamma.</p>\n<p>Her story reminds us that wisdom is not bound by age or status but is found in the sincerity of one\u2019s practice. Like the weaver\u2019s daughter, may we too take to heart the certainty of death, not with fear, but with the resolve to live wisely, cultivating the path that leads beyond suffering.</p>\n<h3>The Weaver\u2019s Daughter\u2019s Second Meeting with the Buddha</h3>\n<p>When the maiden reached the age of nineteen, the Blessed One once again returned to \u0100\u1e37av\u012b.</p>\n<p>One early morning, as the Teacher surveyed the world with his boundless wisdom and compassion, his gaze fell upon her. Encompassing all beings in his vision, he perceived that this young woman had entered the net of his knowledge. He pondered:</p>\n<p><b>\u201cWhat will come of this?\u201d</b></p>\n<p>And seeing with the eye of wisdom, he discerned:</p>\n<p><b>\u201cFrom the day she first heard my discourse, she has earnestly practiced mindfulness of death for three years. Her heart is ripe for deeper understanding. I shall go to \u0100\u1e37av\u012b and guide her further along the path.\u201d</b></p>\n<p>Thus, the Buddha, accompanied by a retinue of five hundred bhikkhus, departed from Jetavana and, in due course, arrived at the Agg\u0101\u1e37ava monastery in \u0100\u1e37av\u012b.</p>\n<p>When word spread that the Blessed One had arrived, the people of the village rejoiced, and so did the young maiden. Hearing of the Buddha\u2019s presence, her heart leaped with joy. She longed to go at once to see the Teacher, to listen to the Dhamma\u2014<b>good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end</b>\u2014a discourse that could illuminate the path to liberation.</p>\n<p>Yet, as she prepared to leave, her father, already on his way to the workshop, turned to her and said:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cDaughter, a garment for a customer is on the loom. I must finish it today. Quickly replenish the shuttle and bring it to me.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>In that moment, the maiden faced an inner conflict. She thought to herself,</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>I long to hear the Buddha\u2019s discourse, yet my father has given me this task. What should I do? If I fail to</i><b><i> </i></b><i>bring him the shuttle, he will surely reprimand me. I will first fulfill my duty to my father, and then, if possible, I will go to hear the Dhamma.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>With this resolve, she sat down on a stool and carefully replenished the shuttle.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the people of \u0100\u1e37av\u012b had prepared a great offering of food for the Buddha and the Sangha. After the meal, they gathered in respectful silence, waiting to hear the Blessed One teach. But the Buddha, knowing the time had not yet come, remained silent. Understanding his intent, the assembled audience\u2014both human and divine\u2014waited in hushed reverence, for when the Teacher is silent, none dare disturb the stillness.</p>\n<p>At last, the young woman completed her task. Placing the shuttle in her basket, she set off toward her father\u2019s workshop. Along the way, she passed by the very place where the Buddha was seated, surrounded by the assembly. Something within her compelled her to stop. She lifted her gaze and beheld the Teacher.</p>\n<p>At that moment, the Buddha also lifted his head and looked upon her.</p>\n<p>There was no need for words\u2014his gaze alone conveyed everything. She understood at once:</p>\n<p><b>\u201cThe Teacher, seated in such an august assembly, looks upon me with meaning. His gaze is an invitation, a silent summons. His sole wish is for me to come into his presence.\u201d</b></p>\n<p>Without hesitation, she set down her shuttle-basket upon the ground and approached the Blessed One. With deep reverence, she bowed at his feet, then satdown respectfully at one side, awaiting his words.</p>\n<p>The entire assembly remained silent; their attention focused on this moment. Then, in the stillness, the Buddha\u2014knower of hearts, guide of the wise\u2014addressed her:</p>\n<h3>Buddhas four questions</h3>\n<p>As the maiden stood before the Blessed One, he addressed her with four profound questions:</p>\n<p><b>\u201cMaiden, whence have you come?\u201d</b></p>\n<p><b>\u201cI know not, venerable sir.\u201d</b></p>\n<p><b>\u201cWhither do you go?\u201d</b></p>\n<p><b>\u201cI know not, venerable sir.\u201d</b></p>\n<p><b>\u201cYou know not?\u201d</b></p>\n<p><b>\u201cI know, venerable sir.\u201d</b></p>\n<p><b>\u201cYou know?\u201d</b></p>\n<p><b>\u201cI know not, venerable sir.\u201d</b></p>\n<p>Upon hearing this unusual exchange, the assembled crowd murmured in confusion. Some were even offended, whispering among themselves:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cSee how this weaver\u2019s daughter speaks so freely with the Fully Enlightened One! When he asked her, \u2018Whence have you come?\u2019 she should have simply answered, \u2018From my father\u2019s house.\u2019 And when he asked, \u2018Whither do you go?\u2019 she should have said, \u2018To the weaver\u2019s workshop.\u2019\u201d</i></p>\n<p>But the Teacher, ever patient and wise, silenced the assembly and turned again to the maiden.</p>\n<p><b>\u201cMaiden, when I asked you, \u2018Whence have you come?\u2019 why did you reply, \u2018I know not\u2019?\u201d</b></p>\n<p>With calm and clarity, she answered:</p>\n<p><b>\u201cVenerable sir, you already know that I have come from my father\u2019s house. But I understood your question to have a deeper meaning: \u2018Whence have you come into this existence?\u2019 And as for that, I do not know.\u201d</b></p>\n<p>The Buddha smiled and said, <b>\u201cWell said, O maiden! You have answered rightly.\u201d</b></p>\n<p>Then, he asked his second question again:</p>\n<p><b>\u201cWhen I asked, \u2018Whither do you go?\u2019 why did you say, \u2018I know not\u2019?\u201d</b></p>\n<p>The maiden replied:</p>\n<p><b>\u201cVenerable sir, you know well that I am going to the weaver\u2019s workshop, carrying my shuttle-basket. But I understood your question to mean, \u2018When you leave this life, where will you be reborn?\u2019 And that, venerable sir, I do not know.\u201d</b></p>\n<p>Again, the Buddha praised her: <b>\u201cWell said! You have answered correctly.\u201d</b></p>\n<p>Then he asked:</p>\n<p><b>\u201cWhen I asked, \u2018Know you not?\u2019 why did you say, \u2018I know\u2019?\u201d</b></p>\n<p>She responded with unwavering certainty:</p>\n<p><b>\u201cVenerable sir, this much I do know\u2014I shall surely die one day. And therefore, I answered, \u2018I know.\u2019\u201d</b></p>\n<p>The Buddha commended her wisdom: <b>\u201cIndeed, you have spoken well.\u201d</b></p>\n<p>Lastly, he asked:</p>\n<p><b>\u201cWhen I asked, \u2018Know you?\u2019 why did you say, \u2018I know not\u2019?\u201d</b></p>\n<p>The maiden replied:</p>\n<p><b>\u201cVenerable sir, I know for certain that death will come. But at what time it will arrive\u2014whether by day or by night, in the morning or evening\u2014that I do not know. And therefore, I answered thus.\u201d</b></p>\n<p>At this, the Buddha declared: <b>\u201cYou have truly answered well.\u201d</b></p>\n<p>Then, turning to the assembly, he addressed them with great compassion:</p>\n<p><b>\u201c</b><i>You who were disturbed by her words failed to grasp their meaning. The world is blind, and those who lack wisdom do not see the truth. But those whose inner eye of wisdom is open; they alone perceive reality as it is.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>And he uttered the following verse: <span id=\"Endnote38\">[<a href=\"#endnote38\">38</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>\"This world is blind; only a few here truly see.</b></p>\n<p><b>As few attain heaven as the birds that escape from the hunter\u2019s net.\"</b><i>:</i></p>\n<p><i>( Andhabh\u016bto aya\u1e41 loko, tanukettha vipassati,</p>\n<p>Sakunto j\u0101lamutto va, appo sagg\u0101ya gacchati.)</i></p>\n<p>As the Buddha concluded his discourse, the young maiden attained the fruit of Stream-entry. Many others, too, were uplifted by his words and gained deep insight into the Dhamma.</p>\n<h3>The Maiden\u2019s Final Moment and the Father\u2019s Awakening</h3>\n<p>With the Teacher\u2019s words still resonating in her heart, the maiden picked up her shuttle-basket and made her way to her father\u2019s workshop. Unaware that he had dozed off at the loom, she approached and presented the basket. Just then, as the basket accidentally struck the tip of the loom, it fell to the ground with a sudden clatter. Startled from his sleep, her father instinctively reached out and pulled the loom. But in that fateful moment, the tip of the loom swung violently and struck his daughter in the chest.</p>\n<p>Without a cry, without hesitation, her life came to an end.</p>\n<p>At that very instant, she was reborn in the celestial realm of Tusita,</p>\n<p>her heart\u2019s purity and wisdom bearing fruit in the heavens.</p>\n<p>Her father, however, saw only her lifeless body before him. Crimson spots of blood marked her form, once full of vitality, now utterly still. A wave of sorrow surged through him, crashing like a great tide. Overcome with grief, he wailed aloud:</p>\n<p><b>\u201c</b><b><i>My daughter, my child! Who will now ease this unbearable sorrow?\u201d</i></b></p>\n<p>Torn by his anguish, he sought out the one refuge that remained\u2014the Buddha, the great comforter of those in suffering. Rushing to the Blessed One, he fell at his feet and cried out:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cVenerable Sir, my daughter is gone! My heart is heavy with sorrow. Please, I beg you, extinguish my grief!\u201d</i></p>\n<p>The Teacher, ever compassionate, looked upon him with gentle understanding and spoke words of deep truth:</p>\n<p><b>\u201c</b><b><i>Grieve not, disciple, for in the endless cycle of birth and death, you have wept for lost loved ones more than all the water contained in the four great oceans.\u201d</i></b></p>\n<p>With these words, the Blessed One revealed to him the boundless nature of sa\u1e43s\u0101ra, the unceasing wanderings through birth and death, joy and sorrow, union and separation\u2014without discernible beginning.</p>\n<p>As the father listened, the storm of his grief began to subside. The truth of the Dhamma settled within him, like a cool rain quenching parched earth. The sorrow that had once consumed him loosened its grip, and in its place arose the desire for true liberation.</p>\n<p>With a heart awakened to the fleeting nature of all things, he bowed before the Teacher and humbly requested ordination. The Blessed One granted his request, and in due time, having diligently practiced the Noble Path, he attained Arahantship\u2014the highest liberation, beyond sorrow, beyond birth and death.</p>\n<p>Thus, from the sorrow of loss arose the light of wisdom, and what had seemed an end became the beginning of final freedom.</p>\n<h2>The Significance of Buddha\u2019s Visit to \u0100\u1e37av\u012b </h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\tThe Buddha\u2019s choice to travel alone underscores his fearlessness and commitment to spreading the Dhamma, even in places where spiritual forces, such as the Yakkha \u0100\u1e37avaka, posed challenges.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\tHis teachings in \u0100\u1e37av\u012b likely left a lasting impact on the region, fostering new disciples and followers.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\tThe presence of Prince Hatta \u0100\u1e37avaka in different stages of life illustrates the long-term influence of the Buddha\u2019s teachings, showing how Dhamma guides people through different phases of life, from childhood to adulthood.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\tThe young daughter of the village weaver had the opportunity to meet the Blessed One, realized the truth was established in the first stage to the noble path.</p>\n<p>This journey, though often overlooked, stands as a powerful testament to the Buddha\u2019s boundless compassion, his ability to tame even the fiercest of beings, and his unwavering dedication to liberating all those trapped in the cycle of suffering.</p>\n<p>The profound lesson we learn here is that the Dhamma is accessible to all\u2014whether a noble prince or a humble, unlettered weaver\u2019s daughter. The Buddha\u2019s teachings transcend social status, offering wisdom perfectly suited to the needs and capacities of each individual. This truth should inspire us to walk the path with unwavering determination, knowing that liberation is not reserved for a select few, but is within reach of anyone who earnestly seeks it. Let us take heart from these great examples and resolve to free ourselves from suffering.</p>\n<h2>The Seventeenth Rainy Season at Veluvana Monastery- Age 51</h2>\n<p>After spending his sixteenth vassa in \u0100\u1e37av\u012b, the Blessed One travelled to R\u0101jagaha and resided at Veluvana Monastery. As mentioned in Section 15-1, he had also spent his second to fourth vassa in R\u0101jagaha. While the scriptures do not explicitly state the location of his seventeenth vassa, commentaries and other sources confirm that he spent this rainy season in the city of R\u0101jagaha.</p>\n<h3>Evidence from other sources</h3>\n<p>1) The seventeenth was surely near R\u0101jagaha (perhaps in Bamboo Wood)<span id=\"Endnote39\">[<a href=\"#endnote39\">39</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>(<b>sattarasama\u1e41 R\u0101jagahe yeva) </b></p>\n<p>2) The unsurpassed Great Seer, whose fame had spread throughout the three realms, in the seventeenth Rains Retreat, dwelt near the excellent R\u0101jagaha, which delighted the eyes with its ramparts, gateways, houses, archways, and so forth.\u00a0<span id=\"Endnote40\">[<a href=\"#endnote40\">40</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>(Bhuvana-ttayasmi\u1e41 pattha\u1e6da-yaso anadhivaro Mahes\u012b, dasasattamamhi Vassamhi, p\u0101k\u0101ra-gopura-niketana-tora\u1e47a-\u0101di netta-abhir\u0101ma-vara-R\u0101jagahe v\u0101sa\u1e41 ak\u0101.)</p>\n<p>3) After taming and converting the Yakka \u00c3lvaka while observing the sixteenth vassa ta \u00c3lavi city, the Buddha exhorted and taught those beings who were worthy of his teaching. When the vassa came to an end, he journeyed from the city of \u00c3lavi and reached the city of R\u0101jagaha eventually and he stayed at the Veleuvana monastery of the city to keep the seventeenth vassa.<span id=\"Endnote41\">[<a href=\"#endnote41\">41</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page16_2/image8.png\" />\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>Road map: Distance from Ghazipur, UP (formerly \u00c3lavi) to Rajgir, Bihar 216 km </b><span id=\"Endnote42\">[<a href=\"#endnote42\">42</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Although neither the scriptures nor the tradition provides a detailed account of the Buddha\u2019s journey from \u0100\u1e37av\u012b to R\u0101jagaha, we can infer that he travelled on foot across a considerable distance\u2014approximately 14.1 yojanas (assuming 1 yojana equals 15 km). Along the way, many fortunate individuals may have had the rare opportunity to encounter the Buddha, listen to his profound teachings, and benefit from his wisdom and boundless compassion. The scriptures and tradition consistently depict the Blessed One as making special efforts to reach those who were receptive to the Dhamma, guiding them toward greater confidence in the teachings and alleviating their suffering.</p>\n<p>Upon his arrival at the serene Veluvana Monastery, the Sa\u1e45gha\u2014who had been eagerly awaiting their teacher\u2019s return, much like hungry children longing for their mother\u2019s nourishment\u2014would have been overjoyed to hear the good Dhamma once more. King Bimbis\u0101ra, a stream-enterer, along with his royal entourage and many devoted followers from Magadha, must have welcomed him with great reverence and delight.</p>\n<h2>Events Before the Commencement of Vassa</h2>\n<p>According to the <i>Dhammapada A\u1e6d\u1e6dhakath\u0101</i> and tradition <span id=\"Endnote43\">[<a href=\"#endnote43\">43</a>]</span>, the Buddha delivered the <i>Vijaya Sutta</i> (Snp 1.11), also known as the <i>K\u0101yavicchandanika Sutta</i>\u2014the discourse on removing desire for the body\u2014during this time. This sutta illustrates the impermanent and impure nature of the body, emphasizing that beauty is merely skin deep. It was specifically preached to help a monk, a disciple of the Buddha, who was struggling with desire for a renowned courtesan in R\u0101jagaha.</p>\n<p>The background story centres on Sirim\u0101 and Uttar\u0101. Uttar\u0101, the daughter of the wealthy merchant Pu\u1e47\u1e47a in R\u0101jagaha, was a devoted follower of the Buddha. When a rich merchant, Sumana, sought her hand for his son, Pu\u1e47\u1e47a hesitated since Sumana\u2019s family were non-believers. After much negotiation, the marriage took place at the onset of the rainy season.</p>\n<p>Once in her new home, Uttar\u0101 was deprived of opportunities to see monks, offer alms, or listen to the Dhamma. After enduring this for two and a half months, she sent a heartfelt message to her parents:</p>\n<p><i>\"Why have you imprisoned me like this? It would have been better to sell me as a slave than to marry me into a family of unbelievers. I have not been able to perform a single act of merit.\"</i></p>\n<h2>The Power of Loving-Kindness and Forgiveness</h2>\n<p>Upon receiving his daughter's anguished message, Pu\u1e47\u1e47a was deeply troubled. Out of compassion, he devised a plan: he sent her fifteen thousand gold coins, instructing her to hire the renowned courtesan, Sirim\u0101, to take her place as a wife for a fortnight. This arrangement freed Uttar\u0101 to engage in meritorious deeds, offering alms and listening to the Buddha\u2019s teachings. Thus, blinded by sensuality, her husband readily agreed\u2014unaware of the fleeting nature of such pleasures.</p>\n<p>Each day, Uttar\u0101 joyfully served the Buddha and his monks. As the rains retreat drew to a close, she busied herself in the kitchen, eagerly preparing for the great alms offering. Seeing her toil, her husband scoffed at what he considered foolish devotion. When Sirim\u0101 noticed his smile, jealousy flared within her. No longer feeling like the mistress of the house, she seized a ladle of boiling oil and, in a fit of rage, rushed toward Uttar\u0101 to harm her.</p>\n<p>Yet, filled with boundless gratitude, Uttar\u0101 bore no anger. She reflected:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\"</i><i>Through Sirim\u0101\u2019s presence, I have been blessed with this rare opportunity to serve the Buddha and hear the Dhamma. If I harbor even a trace of ill will, may this oil burn me. But if my heart is pure, may it cause me no harm.\"</i></p>\n<p>With this thought, she radiated loving-kindness toward Sirim\u0101. When the boiling oil touched her skin, it cooled as if it were pure water.</p>\n<p>Overcome with fury, Sirim\u0101 attempted again, but Uttar\u0101\u2019s maids intervened, restraining and beating her. With unwavering compassion, Uttar\u0101 shielded her attacker and gently asked, <i>\u201cWhy did you do this?\u201d</i></p>\n<p>She then cleansed Sirim\u0101\u2019s wounds and anointed her with fragrant perfume.</p>\n<p>Realizing the enormity of her wrongdoing, Sirim\u0101 was struck with remorse. She thought:</p>\n<p><i>\"I have committed a terrible act, yet Uttar\u0101 harboured no anger and even protected me. If I do not seek her forgiveness, may my head split into seven pieces.\"</i></p>\n<p>Overcome with humility, she prostrated at Uttar\u0101\u2019s feet.</p>\n<p>Uttar\u0101, however, replied,</p>\n<p><i>\u201cIf the father who brought me into this cycle of suffering forgives you, so will I.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>When Sirim\u0101 offered to seek Pu\u1e47\u1e47a\u2019s pardon, Uttar\u0101 gently corrected her: <i>\u201c</i></p>\n<p><i>Pu\u1e47\u1e47a is my father by birth, but the Buddha is the one who leads me out of suffering. If he forgives you, so will I.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>With newfound sincerity, Sirim\u0101 vowed to seek refuge in the Buddha. She resolved to approach him the next day, bringing offerings and humbly asking for his forgiveness.</p>\n<h2>The Triumph of Loving-Kindness</h2>\n<p>Humbled by her wrongdoing, Sirim\u0101 gladly accepted Uttar\u0101\u2019s advice. She returned home and instructed her many attendants to prepare a grand offering of food. The next day, she brought the offerings to Uttar\u0101\u2019s house but, still ashamed, dared not serve the monks herself. Uttar\u0101, embodying boundless kindness, took charge and ensured everything was done with care.</p>\n<p>When the meal was over, Sirim\u0101 knelt at the Buddha\u2019s feet and sought his forgiveness. The Enlightened One asked what she had done. As she recounted the incident, he turned to Uttar\u0101 and inquired about her thoughts when Sirim\u0101 approached her with the boiling oil.</p>\n<p><i>\"I suffused her with loving-kindness,\"</i> Uttar\u0101 replied. <i>\"I reflected that my friend Sirim\u0101 had granted me a great opportunity to perform meritorious deeds.\"</i></p>\n<p><i>\"Excellent, Uttar\u0101, excellent!\"</i> the Blessed One declared. <i>\"That is the true way to overcome anger.\"</i> He then uttered this profound verse:</p>\n<p><i>\"Overcome anger by non-anger, </i></p>\n<p><i>conquer evil by goodness,</i></p>\n<p><i>Conquer the niggardly with a gift,</i></p>\n<p><i>And the liar with truth.\" </i> <span id=\"Endnote44\">[<a href=\"#endnote44\">44</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>With great compassion, the Buddha expounded the Dhamma, revealing the Four Noble Truths. Inspired by his teachings, Uttar\u0101 attained the fruit of once-returning. Her husband, once indifferent to the Dhamma, along with his parents all realized the fruit of stream-entry. Sirim\u0101, too, reached the path of stream-entry, her heart transformed.</p>\n<p>From that day on, Sirim\u0101 dedicated herself to supporting the Sa\u1e45gha. She arranged for eight monks to receive alms at her home daily, issuing invitation vouchers to ensure the offerings were shared fairly among the Order. Her past misdeed became the turning point for a life of generosity and devotion, illustrating the boundless power of loving-kindness and the transformative nature of the Dhamma.</p>\n<h2>The Lesson of Sirim\u0101: The Fleeting Nature of Beauty</h2>\n<p>One day, a monk who had dined at Sirim\u0101\u2019s house returned to his monastery and enthusiastically described the lavish meals she provided. He also praised her extraordinary beauty, claiming that her charm surpassed even the excellence of her offerings. As he spoke, another monk, who had never seen Sirim\u0101, became infatuated with her, overwhelmed by desire. Determined to see her, he secured a meal invitation for the next day.</p>\n<p>However, on that very day, Sirim\u0101 had fallen ill. She lay in bed, weak and without her usual finery. When the monks arrived, she struggled to stand, trembling as two maids supported her. Even in this frail state, the love-struck monk found her beauty captivating and imagined how much more enchanting she must be when adorned with jewels. Overcome by passion, he lost his appetite, returned to the monastery, and lay in anguish, unable to eat for days.</p>\n<p>The Buddha, seeing his plight, resolved to teach a profound lesson. He instructed King Bimbis\u0101ra to place Sirim\u0101\u2019s body in the cemetery for three days after her passing. Then, a royal decree was issued: all adults in R\u0101jagaha must come to see her remains, or face a fine. By the third day, her once-admired body had swollen, decayed, and was crawling with worms, a stark contrast to its former allure.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Hearing that the Buddha was going to see Sirim\u0101, the love-stricken monk, weak from fasting, sprang to his feet at the mere mention of her name. He emptied his bowl, washed it, and rushed to join the crowd. When they arrived, the Buddha turned to King Bimbis\u0101ra and asked, <i>\u201cWho is this, great king?\u201d</i></p>\n<p><i>\"This was Sirim\u0101, the beloved courtesan,\"</i> <span id=\"Endnote45\">[<a href=\"#endnote45\">45</a>]</span>the king replied.</p>\n<p>Then, the Buddha proclaimed: <i>\"Let it be announced that whoever offers a thousand gold coins may have Sirim\u0101.\"</i> But no one came forward. Even when the price was lowered\u2014first to a single coin, then to nothing\u2014not a single person wanted her now.</p>\n<p>Then the Buddha spoke: <i>\u201cMonks, here lies a woman once cherished by many, for whom men paid a thousand gold coins for a single night. Yet now, none will have her, not even for free. Behold the true nature of the body\u2014perishable, fragile, and made appealing only through adornments. It is a house of decay, a burden of suffering. Only fools become attached to such an impermanent thing.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>He then recited this verse:</p>\n<p><i>\"See this skin-bag all adorned;</i></p>\n<p><i>It is just a mass of wounds.</i></p>\n<p><i>Diseased, an object of desires,</i></p>\n<p><i>It has nothing stable or lasting.\"</i>  <span id=\"Endnote46\">[<a href=\"#endnote46\">46</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Hearing this, the love-struck monk saw through his delusion. Deeply contemplating the nature of the body, he developed insight, broke free from craving, and soon attained arahantship.</p>\n<p>Thus, the Blessed One, with unparalleled wisdom, transformed desire into wisdom and infatuation into liberation, revealing the truth of impermanence to all who were ready to see.</p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page16_2/image9.png\" />\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>This seemingly beautiful body is, in truth, nothing more than a mere bundle of bones. When we deeply realize this reality, the illusion of sensual desire\u2014binding us to the endless cycle of samsara\u2014begins to dissolve. With wisdom and insight, we can break free from these attachments and walk the noble path to liberation, untouched by the fleeting illusions of the world. </b><span id=\"Endnote47\">[<a href=\"#endnote47\">47</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Victory Over Delusion</h3>\n<p>This body, though appearing beautiful, is merely a fragile vessel\u2014held together by bones and sinews, filled with impurities, and constantly oozing from its many openings. Yet, blinded by ignorance, one clings to it, mistaking it for something worthy of attachment.</p>\n<p>But when wisdom arises, the truth is seen: this body is impermanent, destined to decay, to be discarded and devoured. Knowing this, the wise abandon desire, breaking free from the chains of delusion. With insight, they transcend suffering and attain the deathless\u2014Nibb\u0101na, the supreme peace.<span id=\"Endnote48\">[<a href=\"#endnote48\">48</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>With that inspiring Dhamma note we will conclude this section.

Based on geographical factors, we speculated that the ancient C\u0101liya Hills might have been located in present-day Jharkhand, near the Bihar border\u2014an area that was once part of the Magadha Kingdom. Interestingly, <b>the Gautam Buddha Wildlife Sanctuary</b>, in Bihar-Jharkhand with its low hills, abundant rivers and lakes, marshy lands and lush forests, aligns with the descriptions of the region. This led us to consider the possibility that the ancient C\u0101liya Hills may have been situated within this natural landscape. However, due to the absence of clear references to C\u0101liya Pabbata in modern maps, this remains an open question.

Moved by compassion, he journeyed to \u0100\u1e37av\u012b to teach him. That day, the farmer had lost his ox and spent hours searching for it. When he finally found it, he remembered that the Buddha was in town and, despite his exhaustion and hunger, hurried to see him without taking any food.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, in \u0100\u1e37av\u012b, the Buddha and his monks had received their meal offering, but the Buddha refrained from giving thanks until the farmer arrived. Upon seeing the weary man, the Buddha did something unprecedented\u2014he asked that food be given to him before teaching the Dhamma. Only after the farmer had eaten and regained his composure did the Buddha deliver his discourse. With a clear and receptive mind, the farmer attained Stream-entry.</p>\n<p>That evening, the monks reflected on this unusual event. Never before had the Buddha personally requested a meal for a householder. Understanding their thoughts, the Buddha explained:</p>\n<p><i>\"Hunger is the greatest affliction. Had I preached to him while he was weak with hunger, he would not have grasped my words. There is no suffering like hunger.\"</i></p>\n<p>Then he recited this verse:</p>\n<p><b>\"Hunger is the worst illness,</b></p>\n<p><b>Conditions are the worst suffering.</b></p>\n<p><b>For one who truly knows this,</b></p>\n<p><b>Nibb\u0101na is the highest happiness.\" </b>(Dhp:203)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The monks listened with deep contemplation. The Buddha elaborated that while physical ailments may be cured for days, months, or even years, hunger demands constant attention\u2014it is the most relentless of all sufferings. Even greater, however, is the suffering caused by conditioned existence itself, the ceaseless cycle of craving and becoming. True freedom, he declared, lies only in the peace of Nibb\u0101na, which, unlike fleeting worldly happiness, is unshaken and enduring.</p>\n<p>By the end of the discourse, many monks attained noble realization, deepening their understanding of the Dhamma.</p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page16_3/image4.jpeg\" />\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>The Blessed One Teaching to the Poor Farmer who was fotunate to become a stream winner </b><span id=\"Endnote10\">[<a href=\"#endnote10\">10</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Benefits of Living Solitude in Forests Groves</h2>\n<p>The Scriptures does not provide specific records of the Buddha\u2019s teachings during these two rainy seasons where he lived in a thick forest grove.  However, throughout his life, the Buddha consistently emphasized the profound spiritual benefits of solitude in remote forest dwellings, guiding his disciples toward deeper meditative development. He also elucidated the significance of his own association with these tranquil retreats, highlighting their role in fostering wisdom and inner peace. Since the Buddha chose to reside in such secluded places during this period, we find it fitting to reflect on his reverence for forest abodes. To illustrate this, we have presented the following suttas, which illuminate his deep appreciation for solitude and the spiritual refuge found in nature.</p>\n<h3>Why Did the Buddha Seek Solitude in the Deep Forest?</h3>\n<p>The Blessed One himself revealed the profound purpose behind his preference for remote forest dwellings:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cBhikkhus, seeing two advantages, I resort to secluded lodgings in forests and jungle groves. What two? For myself, I find a peaceful abiding in this very life, and I have</i><b> </b><i>compassion for</i><b> </b><i>future generations. Seeing these two advantages, I choose to dwell in the solitude of the wilderness.\u201d</i><span id=\"Endnote11\">[<a href=\"#endnote11\">11</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Buddha\u2019s deep compassion extended beyond his own lifetime. By embracing the forest life, he set a timeless example for those who would follow the path. He showed that even one who had already reached the ultimate goal\u2014having nothing left to understand, abandon, develop, or realize\u2014still found value in dwelling in solitude.</p>\n<p>Thus, when young seekers, inspired by faith, witness that the Fully Enlightened One himself did not neglect the forest life, they, too, are moved to cultivate the same discipline. In following his footsteps, they hasten their own liberation and swiftly reach the end of suffering.</p>\n<p>The Buddha\u2019s life was not only a teaching in words but a living testament to the path of renunciation, serenity, and ultimate freedom. His choice to abide in the wilderness was both a personal refuge and an enduring act of compassion, illuminating the way for all who seek the highest truth.</p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page16_3/image5.png\" />\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>Buddha consistently emphasized the profound spiritual benefits of solitude in remote forest dwellings, guiding his disciples toward deeper meditative development </b><span id=\"Endnote12\">[<a href=\"#endnote12\">12</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Who Are the True Forest Dwellers?</h3>\n<p>In this Sutta (AN 5:181), the Blessed One clarifies who can truly be called a forest dweller and who cannot. He describes five types of individuals who take to the forest:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1)\tThe dull and foolish \u2013 One who retreats into the forest due to ignorance and lack of wisdom.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2)\tThe lustful \u2013 One who enters the forest, not out of renunciation, but because of being driven by unwholesome desires.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>3)\tThe mentally unstable \u2013 One who seeks the forest due to confusion, delusion, or madness.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>4)\tThe one motivated by praise \u2013 One who becomes a forest dweller simply because it is lauded by the Buddhas and their disciples.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>5)\tThe true renunciant \u2013 One who chooses the forest life for the sake of fewness of desires, contentment, the elimination of defilements, solitude, and simplicity.</p>\n<p>The Blessed One likens these five types to the progressive refinement of dairy products: from milk to curd, from curd to butter, from butter to ghee, and finally, to the supreme cream of ghee. Likewise, among these five, the one who dwells in the forest for the sake of true renunciation and simplicity is the highest, the most excellent, and the most worthy of honour.</p>\n<p>This teaching reminds us that renunciation is not defined merely by physical seclusion, but by purity of intention. The true forest dweller is not simply one who lives among trees but one who has left behind craving, delusion, and attachment, dwelling in the forest with a heart inclined toward wisdom and liberation.</p>\n<h3>Suitable Conditions for Dwelling in Forest Groves to Enhance the Spiritual Path</h3>\n<p>In the Vanapattha Sutta (MN: 17), the Buddha provides guidance on when a meditative monk should continue residing in a jungle thicket and when he should seek a more suitable place. The decision is based on two key factors: progress on the spiritual path and the availability of requisites necessary for survival.</p>\n<p>The Buddha advises:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1)\tIf a monk is not making progress in his spiritual practice and struggles to obtain basic requisites, he should leave that place.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2)\tIf a monk is not making spiritual progress but has an abundance of requisites, he should also leave.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>3)\tIf a monk is progressing well in his practice but finds it difficult to obtain requisites, he should endure and stay.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>4)\tIf a monk is making good spiritual progress and has sufficient requisites, he should remain in that place.</p>\n<p>Thus, the forest should be a place that nurtures both meditative development and basic sustenance\u2014if it fails to support either, the monk must wisely seek a more conducive environment.</p>\n<h3>Who Is Fit to Live in a Remote Forest Grove?</h3>\n<p>In the A\u1e45guttara Nik\u0101ya (AN 4:262), the Blessed One further clarifies the qualities that determine whether a bhikkhu is suited for living in the solitude of the forest.</p>\n<p>A monk unfit for forest dwelling possesses four unwholesome tendencies:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1)\tSensual thoughts \u2013 His mind is still entangled in sense pleasures.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2)\tThoughts of ill will \u2013 He harbors resentment and anger.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>3)\tThoughts of harming \u2013 His mind inclines toward cruelty rather than compassion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>4)\tLack of wisdom \u2013 He is dull, lacking insight and discernment.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, a monk fit to live in the wilderness has cultivated four noble qualities:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1)\tThoughts of renunciation \u2013 His mind is free from attachment to worldly pleasures.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2)\tThoughts of goodwill \u2013 He radiates compassion and loving kindness <i>(karuna and metta) </i></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>3)\tThoughts of harmlessness \u2013 He is gentle and compassionate toward all beings.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>4)\tWisdom \u2013 He possesses discernment and clarity of mind.</p>\n<p>This teaching underscores that living in solitude is not merely about physical seclusion but about mental refinement. The forest can be a powerful aid on the path, but only for one whose mind is untainted by defilements and firmly established in wisdom, kindness, and renunciation.</p>\n<h3>Further Advice on Dwelling in Remote Forest Groves</h3>\n<p>On one occasion, Venerable Up\u0101li approached the Blessed One, paid homage, sat respectfully to one side, and said: (AN:10:99)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\u201cBhante, I wish to dwell in remote lodgings, deep in the forests and jungle groves.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>With great compassion, the Buddha cautioned him:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cUp\u0101li, dwelling in remote forests and jungle groves is difficult to endure. Solitude is challenging to undertake and hard to find joy in. If a bhikkhu does not develop deep Samadhi, the solitude of the wilderness can unsettle his mind\u201d </i></p>\n<p><i>\u201c It is to be expected that one who says, \u2018I have not yet gained samadhi, yet I will resort to remote lodgings in the forest,\u2019 will either sink or be swept away. He will sink due to sensual thoughts or float away due to thoughts of ill will and harming.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>To illustrate his point, the Blessed One offered a simile:</p>\n<p>\u201cSuppose, Up\u0101li, there was a vast lake, and a mighty bull elephant came along. Thinking, \u2018Let me enter this lake and playfully wash my ears and back; I will bathe, drink, and go wherever I please,\u2019 he steps in. Because of his great size, he finds solid footing in the depths, bathes with ease, and moves freely as he wishes.</p>\n<p>Then, a hare or a cat comes along. Seeing the bull elephant, it thinks, \u2018How is he any different from me? I too will enter this lake, wash my ears and back, bathe, and drink as I please.\u2019 But without reflecting, it hastily plunges into the deep waters\u2014only to be either dragged under or carried away by the current.</p>\n<p>Why? Because its small body cannot find footing in the depths.</p>\n<p>So too, Up\u0101li, if one who has not yet attained Samadhi seeks to dwell in remote forests and jungle groves, it is to be expected that he will either sink or be swept away.\u201d</p>\n<h4><i>Insight from This Teaching</i></h4>\n<p>The Buddha\u2019s compassionate advice highlights that <b>seclusion is not merely a matter of external solitude but requires inner stability</b>. Just as a mighty elephant can navigate deep waters while a small creature is easily overcome, a bhikkhu with <b>strong Samadhi and wisdom</b> can thrive in the solitude of the forest. However, one who is <b>not yet grounded in meditative discipline</b> may find himself overwhelmed, unable to withstand the mind\u2019s unchecked wanderings.</p>\n<p>Thus, before seeking the deep solitude of the forest, one must first establish a <b>firm footing in Samadhi  and insight</b>, ensuring that solitude becomes a support for the path rather than a source of danger.</p>\n<p>With that profound advice from the Blessed One we will end this section. In the next section (17-1), we will examine where the Buddha spent his twentieth vassa.</p>\n<h3>End Notes: Section 16-3</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<span id=\"endnote1\">[<a href=\"#Endnote1\">1</a>]</span>\t Source: https://www.wildbihar.org/gautam-buddha-bird-sanctuary\n<p></p>\n<span id=\"endnote2\">[<a href=\"#Endnote2\">2</a>]</span>\t Ibid.\n<p></p>\n<span id=\"endnote3\">[<a href=\"#Endnote3\">3</a>]</span>\t Google map.\n<p></p>\n<span id=\"endnote4\">[<a href=\"#Endnote4\">4</a>]</span>\t Source: https://www.facebook.com/GayaFD/videos/watch-a-beautiful-eco-cultural-tourism-site-in-gautam-buddha-wildlife-sanctuary-/4015327725152440/\n<p></p>\n<span id=\"endnote5\">[<a href=\"#Endnote5\">5</a>]</span>\t See: AN: Notes: 1830.\n<p></p>\n<span id=\"endnote6\">[<a href=\"#Endnote6\">6</a>]</span>\t Source 1: Madhuratthavil\u0101sin\u012b (Buddhava\u1e41satthakath\u0101) of Bhadant\u00e2cariya Buddhadatta Mahathera: Translated by I.

He eventually arrived in the city of R\u0101jagaha, the capital of the Magadha Kingdom, and took residence in the serene and beautiful Ve\u1e37uvana Monastery, also known as the Bamboo Grove. At this stage of his life, the Blessed One was around fifty-four years old\u2014an age of maturity and wisdom.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Both traditional accounts and other sources indicate that the Buddha spent this vassa in and around R\u0101jagaha.

When the Blessed One inquired about his sudden visit, Dhammika confessed that he had been expelled from seven monasteries due to his unwholesome conduct toward fellow monastics. Banished with nowhere else to turn, he had come seeking the Buddha\u2019s guidance.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>With great compassion, the Buddha shared a parable:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Once, King Koravya had a magnificent banyan tree that bore fruits as sweet as honey. Its five great branches provided for different groups\u2014the royal family, officials, commoners, ascetics, and animals. Each took only what they needed, harming no part of the tree. However, an outsider greedily stripped the tree of its fruits and broke its branches. Disturbed by this, the tree deva, its guardian spirit, wished that the tree would stop bearing fruit\u2014and so it did.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Concerned, King Koravya sought help from Sakka, the king of the devas. In response, Sakka conjured a storm and uprooted the tree. Devastated at losing his home, the tree deva lamented his fate. Sakka then advised him:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\"Had you practiced the duty of a tree\u2014allowing all to take what they needed without resentment\u2014this disaster would not have occurred.\"</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Realizing his mistake, the tree deva vowed to fulfill his duty, and through Sakka\u2019s supernatural power, the tree was restored.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>After sharing this story, the Buddha turned to Dhammika and asked:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\"Dhammika, have you been following the duty of an ascetic?\"</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>He then explained:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\"An ascetic does not insult one who insults him, does not scold one who scolds him, and does not argue with one who argues with him. This is how an ascetic fulfills his duty.\"</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Buddha further emphasized this truth in verse:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\"One who harms a noble bhikkhu first harm himself, then harms the other. But one who protects himself also protects others. Therefore, the wise should safeguard themselves, remaining unshaken and unharmed.\"</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Through this profound teaching, the Buddha reminded Dhammika\u2014and all practitioners\u2014that true renunciation is not merely about external appearances but about inner restraint, patience, and unwavering equanimity.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>The Noble Qualities of an Arahant</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>In these discourses (AN 9:7 &amp; 9:8), the two wanderers approached the Buddha with a profound inquiry regarding the nature of an arahant\u2014the perfected one, free from all defilements. They sought to understand the incapability of an arahant to commit transgressions. The Buddha, in his boundless wisdom, confirmed:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\u201cA bhikkhu who is an arahant is incapable of transgression in nine ways.\u201d</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>An arahant, having completely eradicated the roots of greed, hatred, and delusion, is utterly incapable of engaging in the following:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1)\t<b>Taking life</b> \u2013 An arahant cannot intentionally deprive a living being of life.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2)\t<b>Stealing</b> \u2013 An arahant cannot take what is not given, by way of theft.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>3)\t<b>Engaging in sexual intercourse</b> \u2013 Having fully transcended sensual desires, an arahant is incapable of such acts.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>4)\t<b>Speaking falsehood</b> \u2013 Devoid of deceit, an arahant cannot deliberately utter falsehoods.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>5)\t<b>Hoarding for sensual pleasure</b> \u2013 Having abandoned worldly attachments, an arahant does not accumulate possessions for personal enjoyment as he once did in lay life.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>6)\t<b>Rejecting the Buddha</b> \u2013 An arahant has unshakable confidence in the Enlightened One.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>7)\t<b>Rejecting the Dhamma</b> \u2013 An arahant never turns away from the liberating truth.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>8)\t<b>Rejecting the Sa\u1e45gha</b> \u2013 An arahant remains firmly devoted to the community of noble disciples.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>9)\t<b>Rejecting the training</b> \u2013 Having perfected the path, an arahant does not deviate from the noble discipline.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This teaching illuminates the supreme purity of an arahant\u2014one who has transcended the realm of moral struggle and abides in the flawless peace of Nibb\u0101na. The ninefold incapability is not a mere restraint but the natural expression of complete liberation. Just as a lotus remains untouched by the water in which it blooms, the arahant moves through the world yet remains untainted by its defilements.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Dhamma Teachings to the wanderer Sakulud\u0101yin</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>During his stay in R\u0101jagaha, the Buddha, out of deep compassion, imparted many profound teachings to the wandering ascetics of other sects. Among these, two remarkable discourses in the <i>Majjhima Nik\u0101ya</i> were delivered to the wanderer Sakulud\u0101yin. We have already explored the <i>Mah\u0101sakulud\u0101yi Sutta</i> (MN:77) in Section 7. Now, we turn to the second discourse, the <i>C\u016b\u1e37asakulud\u0101yi Sutta</i> (MN:79), which offers a teaching of immense depth and significance.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>On one occasion in response to Sakulud\u0101yin\u2019s inquiry, the Blessed One declared:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\"It is not for the sake of realizing an exclusively pleasant world that bhikkhus lead the holy life under me. There are other states, Ud\u0101yin, higher and more sublime than that, and it is for the sake of realizing them that bhikkhus lead the holy life under me.\"</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>With these words, the Buddha guided Sakulud\u0101yin toward the essence of the Dhamma\u2014the progressive refinement of the mind leading to the ultimate liberation, <i>Nibb\u0101na.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Buddha explained how a bhikkhu in his dispensation attains these higher and more sublime states. First, he establishes unwavering faith in the Buddha and diligently cultivates wholesome qualities. Abandoning the five hindrances\u2014the mental defilements that obscure wisdom\u2014he enters into the profound states of meditative absorption (<i>jh\u0101na</i>).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Having thus abandoned these five hindrances, imperfections of the mind that weaken wisdom, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the first <i>jh\u0101na</i>\u2026 up to the fourth <i>jh\u0101na.</i> These are called higher and more sublime states, for the sake of realizing which bhikkhus lead the holy life under the Buddha.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Beyond deep meditative absorption, the bhikkhu further develops the threefold knowledge (<i>tevijj\u0101</i>):</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1)\tThe recollection of past lives (<i>pubbeniv\u0101s\u0101nussati\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a</i>).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2)\tThe divine eye (<i>dibbacakkhu</i>), by which he perceives the arising and passing of beings according to their kamma.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>3)\tThe knowledge of the destruction of the taints (<i>\u0101savakkhaya\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a</i>), through which he realizes the cessation of all suffering.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Upon seeing and knowing thus, his mind is liberated from the taint of sensual desire, from the taint of existence, and from the taint of ignorance. With this, the realization dawns:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>\u201cBirth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being.\u201d</b></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Hearing this sublime teaching, Sakulud\u0101yin was deeply moved. A seed of faith was planted within him, and he earnestly sought to go forth under the Buddha, renouncing the worldly life to pursue the path to liberation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>However, the weight of past kamma and the influence of his students prevented him from taking this noble step. They urged him to reconsider, saying:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\u201cDo not lead the holy life under the recluse Gotama, Master Ud\u0101yin. Having been a teacher, Master Ud\u0101yin, do not live as a pupil. For Master Ud\u0101yin to do so would be as if a water jug were to become a mere pitcher.\u201d</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Thus, bound by attachments and entangled in worldly pride, he was obstructed from walking the path of deliverance. This is the sorrowful reality of unwholesome kamma\u2014it can hinder even the most promising aspirations for spiritual growth.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Yet, the seed of the Dhamma, once planted, never truly perishes. Perhaps in another time, in another life, the wanderer Sakulud\u0101yin would again encounter the path, and with wisdom, take the steps he was once denied.<span id=\"Endnote5\">[<a href=\"#endnote5\">5</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>The Spiritual Transformation of Venerable Pukkus\u0101ti</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>Pukkus\u0101ti, once the king of Takkasil\u0101, became a seeker of truth after receiving a golden plate from King Bimbis\u0101ra, inscribed with praises of the Three Jewels. Deeply moved, he renounced his throne, donned the robes of an ascetic, and set out to meet the Buddha in S\u0101vatth\u012b. <span id=\"Endnote6\">[<a href=\"#endnote6\">6</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Through his divine vision, the Buddha saw Pukkus\u0101ti\u2019s potential for enlightenment and, out of boundless compassion, journeyed to meet him in a potter\u2019s shed in R\u0101jagaha. Concealing his extraordinary marks, the Blessed One appeared as a simple monk. That night, both sat in deep meditation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>When questioned about his teacher, Pukkus\u0101ti declared that he followed the recluse Gotama\u2014unaware that the very Teacher he sought was before him. Seeing his readiness, the Buddha expounded the profound <i>Dh\u0101tuvibhanga Sutta</i> (MN:140), revealing the nature of existence through the six elements, six bases of contact, and the eighteen ways the mind explores experience. He taught that one who transcends these, standing firmly on the four foundations\u2014wisdom, truth, relinquishment, and peace\u2014becomes a <i>sage at peace,</i> beyond the tides of conceiving.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Upon hearing this sublime discourse, realization dawned upon Pukkus\u0101ti: <i>\"Indeed, the Teacher has come to me!\"</i> Overcome with reverence, he prostrated at the Buddha\u2019s feet, filled with faith and joy. Wishing to formally ordain, he left to seek a bowl and robes. Yet, before he could return, fate intervened\u2014a stray cow took his life.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>When asked of his destiny, the Buddha declared:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\"With the destruction of the five lower fetters, Pukkus\u0101ti has been reborn in the Pure Abodes. There, he will attain final Nibb\u0101na, never to return to this world.\"</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Thus, though his time in the human realm was brief, Pukkus\u0101ti\u2019s unwavering faith, wisdom, and practice led him to the highest path. His journey reminds us that the Dhamma, once realized, transcends even death, guiding beings toward the ultimate liberation.<span id=\"Endnote7\">[<a href=\"#endnote7\">7</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Brief Yet Profound Discourses of the Buddha</h2>\n<p>While residing in R\u0101jagaha, the Blessed One delivered several brief yet deeply insightful teachings, illuminating the nature of life and the path to liberation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Fleeting Nature of Life (SN 4:9 &amp; 10)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Buddha reminded the bhikkhus of the fleeting nature of human existence:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cBhikkhus, the life span of human beings is short. One must inevitably move on to the next existence. Therefore, one should cultivate wholesome deeds and lead the holy life. For one who has taken birth, there is no escape from death. Even one who lives long may reach but a hundred years\u2014or a little more.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>Reflecting on this, the Buddha offered a stirring verse:</p>\n<p>Short is the life span of human beings,</p>\n<p>The wise should not be heedless.</p>\n<p>One should live as if one\u2019s head were aflame,</p>\n<p>For death is certain and cannot be avoided.</p>\n<p>Like water dwindling in a drying stream, each moment brings us closer to the end of life. Recognizing this truth, the Buddha urged:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cLife is swept away; short is the life span.</p>\n<p>There is no refuge for one who has grown old.</p>\n<p>Seeing this danger in death,</p>\n<p>A seeker of peace should abandon the world\u2019s bait.\u201d</i> <i>(SN 2:19)</i></p>\n<p>These words awaken urgency in the heart, reminding us to use our fleeting time wisely, striving for what truly matters.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Killing Praised by the Noble Ones (SN 7:1)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Once, a young brahmin asked the Buddha whether he ever approved of killing. In response, the Buddha offered a profound teaching:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cHaving slain anger, one sleeps soundly;</p>\n<p>Having slain anger, one sorrows no more.</p>\n<p>Anger, with its poisoned root and honeyed tip\u2014</p>\n<p>This is what the noble ones praise killing,</p>\n<p>For having slain this, one grieves no more.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>Unlike the destruction of life, the destruction of anger leads to peace. Anger, though often enticing at first\u2014like honey on the tongue\u2014ultimately poisons the heart. True victory lies not in harming others but in conquering one\u2019s own defilements.</p>\n<p>Through these brief yet powerful discourses, the Buddha urges us to awaken, to see the fragility of life, and to abandon the poisons that keep us bound to suffering.</p>\n<h3>Venerable \u0100nanda: The Humble and Devoted Attendant of the Buddha</h3>\n<p>For the first twenty years of his ministry, the Blessed One had no permanent attendant. Various bhikkhus\u2014such as Venerables Cunda, Meghiya, N\u0101gasam\u0101la, and Upav\u0101na\u2014served him at different times. However, as the Buddha grew older, residing in R\u0101jagaha, he addressed the Sangha:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cBhikkhus, I have grown old now. It is time to have a bhikkhu as my constant attendant.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>Upon hearing this, Venerable S\u0101riputta, renowned for his wisdom, respectfully offered to take on the role. However, the Buddha, ever mindful of each disciple\u2019s unique qualities, declined, saying:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cS\u0101riputta, wherever you are, there is the Dhamma. Your duty is to teach as I do. You should not serve as my attendant.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>One by one, other great disciples also offered themselves, but the Buddha declined them all.</p>\n<p>Amidst the gathering, Venerable \u0100nanda remained silent. Seeing this, the bhikkhus urged him to step forward, but he humbly replied:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cFriends, this position is not something to be sought. If the Buddha wishes it, he will call upon me.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>The Buddha, perceiving \u0100nanda\u2019s sincerity and devotion, then declared:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cBhikkhus, \u0100nanda does not need to be asked\u2014he will serve out of his own free will.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>Thus, Venerable \u0100nanda, with deep humility and boundless love, became the Blessed One\u2019s devoted attendant.</p>\n<h4><i>A Life of Service and Loving Devotion</i></h4>\n<p>For twenty-five years, Venerable \u0100nanda served the Buddha with unwavering care, ensuring his every need was met. He was always available to assist the Sangha and lay disciples, offering guidance with a kind and patient heart. His remarkable memory preserved countless teachings, and his eloquence brought inspiration to all who listened.</p>\n<p>The Buddha praised him in many ways, declaring:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cBhikkhus, among those who are learned, \u0100nanda is foremost. Among those with a good memory, \u0100nanda is foremost. Among those with a quick grasp, \u0100nanda is foremost. Among those who are resolute, \u0100nanda is foremost. Among personal attendants, \u0100nanda is foremost.\u201d</i> (AN 1:209)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>His presence was a source of joy and inspiration for all:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cWhen bhikkhus, bhikkhun\u012bs, male lay followers, or female lay followers see \u0100nanda, they are elated. When he speaks, they are uplifted. Even when he falls silent, they are never satisfied, wishing to hear more.\u201d</i> (AN 4:129)</p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page17/image3.png\" />\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\">Venerable \u0100nanda: Tibetan Illustration <span id=\"Endnote8\">[<a href=\"#endnote8\">8</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In his own words, Venerable \u0100nanda reflected on his years of service:</p>\n<p>\u201cFor twenty-five years,</p>\n<p>I attended the Blessed One</p>\n<p>With loving deeds,</p>\n<p>Like a shadow that never left.</p>\n<p>For twenty-five years,</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I attended the Blessed One</p>\n<p>With loving words,</p>\n<p>Like a shadow that never left.</p>\n<p>For twenty-five years,</p>\n<p>I attended the Blessed One</p>\n<p>With loving thoughts,</p>\n<p>Like a shadow that never left.\u201d (Thag 1044\u20131046)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Venerable \u0100nanda embodied the noble qualities of humility, devotion, and selfless service. His unwavering dedication ensured that the teachings of the Buddha were preserved for future generations, a legacy of compassion and wisdom that continues to guide seekers of the Dhamma.</p>\n<p>With this inspiring account of Venerable \u0100nanda, we conclude this section.

Through her wisdom and skilful means, Vis\u0101kh\u0101 gradually won their hearts, guiding them to the Buddha\u2019s teachings. Eventually, her father-in-law, Mig\u0101ra, embraced the Dhamma and became a devoted follower. In honour of this transformation, Vis\u0101kh\u0101 was thereafter affectionately called <b>Mig\u0101ram\u0101t\u0101,</b> or \"Mother of Mig\u0101ra.\"</p>\n<h3>The Building of Pubb\u0101r\u0101ma Monastery</h3>\n<p>The story of how Vis\u0101kh\u0101 built Pubb\u0101r\u0101ma Monastery is one of deep devotion and noble intention.</p>\n<p>One day, while visiting Jetavana Monastery, Vis\u0101kh\u0101 lost some of her valuable jewelry.

Instead, she resolved to sell the jewellery and dedicate the proceeds to constructing a monastery where the Buddha and his Sa\u1e45gha could reside in S\u0101vatth\u012b.</p>\n<p>With the Buddha\u2019s blessing, Venerable Mah\u0101 Moggall\u0101na oversaw the construction of the monastery. Within just nine months, a magnificent two-story monastery, fully equipped with all necessary facilities, was completed. Since it was built near the eastern gate of S\u0101vatth\u012b, it became known as Pubb\u0101r\u0101ma \u2013 the Eastern Monastery<b>.</b> However, in both scripture and tradition, it was more commonly referred to as Mig\u0101ram\u0101tup\u0101s\u0101da \u2013 the Palace of Mig\u0101ram\u0101t\u0101<b>,</b> in honour of Vis\u0101kh\u0101\u2019s profound generosity.</p>\n<p>Pubb\u0101r\u0101ma was not merely a place of shelter but a sacred space where countless beings, from monastics to lay devotees, found inspiration, guidance, and refuge in the Buddha\u2019s teachings.

The background story goes like this: While the Buddha was residing in S\u0101vatthi, Venerable Uppalava\u1e47\u1e47\u0101 was living in Andhavana, a forest grove south of the city of S\u0101vatthi, there living in solitude she was attacked by a young man who was a cousin of her who wanted to marry her during her lay life, but seen the calamity of household life she refused many such offers and became a disciple of the Buddha. The Buddha with his deep compassion prohibited bhikkhunis to live alone in forest groves without protection.<span id=\"Endnote18\">[<a href=\"#endnote18\">18</a>]</span> Hence, the King built a beautiful monastery for the nuns.</p>\n<p>In SN5: Bhikkhunisamutta refers to this abode as \u2018Bhikkhuni Quatres\u2019, according to the discourses in that samyutta many bhikkhunis were residing there when the Buddha was spending his long stay in S\u0101vatthi , among them were bhikkhunis: Uppalava\u1e47\u1e47\u0101  \u0100\u1e37avik\u0101, Som\u0101, Kis\u0101gotam\u012b, Vijay\u0101, C\u0101l\u0101, Upac\u0101l\u0101, S\u012bsupac\u0101l\u0101 ,Sel\u0101  and Vajir\u0101. <span id=\"Endnote19\">[<a href=\"#endnote19\">19</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>According to tradition this was the second monastery dedicated to the Nuns.

Each of these teachings played a vital role in the spiritual progress of the disciples and cannot be ranked or compared\u2014just as gold mined from the earth is precious in every form, each word of the Blessed One is invaluable. However, to illuminate the essence of his wisdom, we have selected a few key teachings that offer deep insight into the path of purification<b>.</b></p>\n<h3>How to Destroy the Taints</h3>\n<p>In the <i>Sabb\u0101sava Sutta</i> (MN: 2), the Buddha expounds on the nature of taints (<i>\u0101savas</i>)\u2014the deep-rooted defilements that bind beings to the cycle of birth and death. He teaches seven methods by which these taints can be restrained and abandoned:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1)\tAbandoning by Seeing \u2013 Through wise attention (<i>yoniso manasik\u0101ra</i>), one should avoid unskilful perceptions that give rise to sensual desire, ill will, restlessness, laziness, and doubt. Instead, by contemplating the Four Noble Truths with clarity, one can uproot the fetters of personality view, doubt, and attachment to rites and rituals.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2)\tAbandoning by Restraining \u2013 The wise disciple practices mindfulness and restraint over the six sense faculties (eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind). By guarding the senses, one prevents the arising of sensual fever, ill will, and other unwholesome states.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>3)\tAbandoning by Using \u2013 Reflection on the proper use of requisites (robes, alms food, dwelling, and medicine) is crucial. These should be used not for indulgence, adornment, or pleasure but solely to maintain the body for the sake of spiritual cultivation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>4)\tAbandoning by Enduring \u2013 One must develop patience and endurance in the face of external hardships, such as heat and cold, hunger and thirst, insect bites, harsh speech from others, and physical discomfort. By accepting these challenges with wisdom, the mind remains undisturbed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>5)\tAbandoning by Avoiding \u2013 With careful discernment, one avoids situations that could hinder spiritual growth. This includes physical dangers (such as wild animals or perilous locations like cliffs and swamps), harmful associations (such as unwholesome companions who encourage misconduct), and places of immorality (such as gambling houses, bars, and other sites of indulgence in sensual pleasures).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>6)\tAbandoning by Removing \u2013 When unwholesome thoughts of sensuality, ill will, or delusion arise, one must apply mindfulness and right effort to swiftly remove them, replacing them with wholesome mental states that support the path.</p>\n<p>These seven methods serve as essential tools for the Sangha in their pursuit of liberation, helping them sever the chains of defilement and move towards the ultimate goal\u2014Nibb\u0101na.</p>\n<h3>Overcoming Anger and Ill Will</h3>\n<p>On one occasion, while residing in S\u0101vatth\u012b, the Buddha addressed the monks, saying:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cBhikkhus, there are five kinds of speech that others may use when they speak to you. Their words may be timely or untimely, true or false, gentle or harsh, beneficial or harmful, spoken with a mind of loving-kindness or with inner hatred. Regardless of how others address you\u2014whether their words are kind or cruel, truthful or deceptive, spoken with goodwill or malice\u2014your response must be rooted in wisdom and restraint\u201d. </i><span id=\"Endnote23\">[<a href=\"#endnote23\">23</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Here, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves in this way:</p>\n<p><i>\u2018Our minds shall remain unshaken, and we shall utter no evil words. We shall abide with a heart full of compassion, wishing only for the welfare of others. With a mind free from hatred, we shall pervade even those who speak harshly with boundless loving-kindness. Beginning with them, we shall extend this goodwill to the entire world\u2014\u2014vast, exalted, immeasurable, and free from hostility and ill will.\u2019</i></p>\n<p>Bhikkhus, even if bandits were to seize you and savagely cut you limb by limb with a two-handled saw, if you were to give rise to even a moment of hatred towards them, you would not be following my teaching. Instead, you should train in this way:</p>\n<p><i>\u2018Even in the face of unbearable cruelty, our minds shall remain unshaken, and we shall utter no harsh words. We shall abide in unwavering compassion, free from resentment. We shall pervade even our tormentors with a heart of loving-kindness, without ill will.\u2019</i></p>\n<p>Bhikkhus, if you hold firmly to this teaching\u2014this simile of the saw\u2014do you see any form of speech, whether trivial or severe, that you could not endure?\u201d</p>\n<p>The monks replied, \u201cNo, venerable sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTherefore, bhikkhus, keep this teaching close to your hearts at all times. Doing so will bring you welfare and happiness for a long time.\u201d</p>\n<p>This profound teaching of the Blessed One conveys the profound strength of patience and loving-kindness in the face of all provocations. It reminds us that true spiritual mastery lies not in seeking favourable conditions, but in maintaining unwavering compassion even under the harshest circumstances.</p>\n<h3>The Danger of Misapprehending the Dhamma</h3>\n<p>To warn against the dangers of grasping the Dhamma with the wrong intention, the Buddha gave this profound teaching in the <i>Alagadd\u016bpama Sutta</i> (MN:22).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cBhikkhus, some misguided individuals learn the Dhamma, but instead of reflecting on its true meaning with wisdom, they use it merely to criticize others and win debates. Failing to apply it for inner transformation, they derive no real benefit. Misinterpreted and misused, the Dhamma becomes a cause of their own harm and suffering\u2014just as a man who carelessly grasps a snake by its tail or coils risks being bitten, leading to great pain or even death.\u201d</p>\n<p>On the other hand, those who learn the Dhamma with right intention examine its meaning with wisdom, develop deep understanding, and apply it to their lives. They do not seek to argue but to cultivate inner peace and liberation. Such individuals, having grasped the Dhamma correctly, experience true welfare and happiness\u2014just as a skilled person, using a cleft stick, grasps a snake properly by the neck and avoids harm.</p>\n<p>Thus, the Buddha advised:</p>\n<p><b>\u201cBhikkhus, if you understand my teachings, remember them well. If you do not, seek guidance from me or from wise bhikkhus.\u201d</b></p>\n<p>This teaching reminds us that the Dhamma is not meant for intellectual pride or debate but for liberation. When grasped correctly\u2014with wisdom, humility, and sincerity\u2014it leads to the highest happiness.</p>\n<h3>Advice to Venerable Bhadd\u0101li</h3>\n<p>Once, while residing at Jetavana Monastery, the Buddha gave a firm yet compassionate teaching to Venerable Bhadd\u0101li to help him overcome stubbornness and progress on the path</p>\n<p>The Buddha instructed the monks:</p>\n<p><i>\"Bhikkhus, I eat only one meal a day. By doing so, I remain free from illness, experience lightness, strength, and a comfortable abiding. You too should follow this practice to gain the same benefits.\"</i><span id=\"Endnote24\">[<a href=\"#endnote24\">24</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>However, Venerable Bhadd\u0101li resisted, fearing discomfort. When the Buddha formally introduced this training rule, Bhadd\u0101li refused to comply and, feeling ashamed, avoided the Buddha for the entire three-month Rains Retreat.</p>\n<p>Out of concern for his well-being, some monks urged him:</p>\n<p><i>\"Friend Bhadd\u0101li, the Buddha\u2019s robe is being prepared, and when it is completed, he will set out on his journey. Take this opportunity to approach him before it becomes more difficult for you.\"</i></p>\n<p>Realizing his mistake, Bhadd\u0101li finally sought the Buddha\u2019s forgiveness:</p>\n<p><i>\"Venerable Sir, please forgive my transgression, seen as such, for the sake of future restraint.\"</i></p>\n<p>The Buddha, ever compassionate, pardoned him and gave this profound teaching:</p>\n<h4><i>The Simile of the Thoroughbred Colt</i></h4>\n<p><i>\u201c Bhadd\u0101li, suppose a skilled horse trainer acquires a fine thoroughbred colt. First, he trains the colt to wear a bit. Since this is unfamiliar, the colt resists\u2014writhing and struggling. But with patience, repetition, and gradual practice, it learns to accept the bit with ease.</i></p>\n<p><i>Next, the trainer introduces the harness. Again, the colt resists at first but, through steady training, becomes accustomed to it. The trainer then teaches it to step in rhythm, run in circles, prance, gallop, and charge\u2014refining its skills until it develops the noble qualities of a king\u2019s horse: speed, agility, and gentleness. Finally, when the colt masters all these actions, it is rewarded with care and grooming. When a thoroughbred colt possesses these ten qualities, it is fit to serve a king and is regarded as one of the king\u2019s prized assets.\"</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page18/image12.png\" />\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>The Buddha, ever compassionate, pardoned Venerable Bhadd\u0101li </b><span id=\"Endnote25\">[<a href=\"#endnote25\">25</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Then the Blessed One further said:</p>\n<p><i>\"Bhadd\u0101li</i><b><i>, a bhikkhu with ten qualities</i></b><i> is truly worthy of offerings, hospitality, reverence, and is an unsurpassed field of merit for the world. What are these ten? A bhikkhu must possess the right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration, right knowledge, and right deliverance\u2014each perfected beyond mere training. When a bhikkhu attains these, he becomes a beacon of virtue and wisdom.\"</i></p>\n<p>Hearing these words, Venerable Bhadd\u0101li was deeply satisfied and delighted in the Buddha\u2019s teaching.</p>\n<p>This story reminds us that even when discipline feels challenging, true growth comes from humility, self-reflection, and aligning with the Dhamma.</p>\n<h3>Advice to Venerable Pu\u1e47\u1e47a</h3>\n<p>While residing at Jetavana Monastery, the Blessed One was approached by Venerable Pu\u1e47\u1e47a, who paid homage and respectfully requested a brief teaching that would enable him to dwell in solitude and practice diligently. <span id=\"Endnote26\">[<a href=\"#endnote26\">26</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>With boundless compassion, the Buddha imparted a concise yet profound discourse. He explained how suffering arises due to craving and how it ceases with the abandonment of craving. Elaborating further, he taught:</p>\n<p><i>\"When delight arises in relation to the eye and forms\u2014or to any of the six sense faculties and their objects\u2014the suffering of the five aggregates follows. Thus, the arising of suffering and its origin can be understood through the six senses. But if a bhikkhu does not delight in, welcome, or cling to these external objects\u2014whether sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touches, or thoughts\u2014then delight ceases in him. And with the cessation of delight, Pu\u1e47\u1e47a, there is the cessation of suffering.\"</i></p>\n<p>After delivering this discourse, the Buddha inquired about where Venerable Pu\u1e47\u1e47a intended to practice. Upon hearing that he planned to go to Sun\u0101paranta, the Buddha cautioned him:</p>\n<p><i>\"Pu\u1e47\u1e47a, the people of Sun\u0101paranta are fierce and rough. If they abuse and threaten you, how will you respond?\"</i></p>\n<p>Venerable Pu\u1e47\u1e47a replied with remarkable patience and wisdom, saying that if they merely abused him, he would consider them kind for not striking him. The Buddha continued to challenge him:</p>\n<p>\"But what if they strike you with their fists?\"</p>\n<p>\"Then I shall think: 'How fortunate that they did not strike me with a clod of earth.'\"</p>\n<p>\"And if they do strike you with a clod?\"</p>\n<p>\"Then I shall think: 'How kind they are for not striking me with a stick.'\"</p>\n<p>The Buddha pressed further, asking what he would think if they struck him with a stick, a knife, or even took his life. Each time, Pu\u1e47\u1e47a responded with unwavering equanimity, seeing even death as an opportunity for final liberation. Deeply pleased, the Buddha affirmed:</p>\n<p>\"Good, good, Pu\u1e47\u1e47a! With such self-restraint and serenity, you will be able to dwell in Sun\u0101paranta.\"</p>\n<p>True to his resolve, Venerable Pu\u1e47\u1e47a journeyed to Sun\u0101paranta and lived according to the teachings. Scriptures record that through his efforts, five hundred laymen and five hundred laywomen took refuge in the Dhamma. In time, he passed away.</p>\n<p>When news of his passing reached Jetavana, some bhikkhus approached the Buddha, asking about his fate. The Blessed One replied:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cBhikkhus, the clansman Pu\u1e47\u1e47a was wise. He practiced in accordance with the Dhamma and never troubled me with questions about its meaning. He has attained final Nibb\u0101na.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>Thus, Venerable Pu\u1e47\u1e47a\u2019s unwavering resolve and steadfast practice serve as a shining example of true renunciation and fearlessness in the path to liberation.</p>\n<h3>An\u0101thapi\u1e47\u1e0dika\u2019s Progress on the Path and His Final Moment</h3>\n<p>An\u0101thapi\u1e47\u1e0dika, the foremost male lay devotee of the Buddha, was renowned for his boundless generosity and deep devotion. Though immensely wealthy, he remained humble and used his fortune to support the Sangha, providing the four requisites with a heart full of faith. His selfless giving was not merely an act of charity but a path to spiritual progress, leading him closer to liberation.</p>\n<p>In his final days, as he lay gravely ill, Venerable S\u0101riputta visited him and offered profound guidance, recorded in MN: 143: An\u0101thapi\u1e47\u1e0dikov\u0101da Sutta:</p>\n<p><i>\"Householder, you should train thus: \u2018I will not cling to what is seen, heard, sensed, cognized, encountered, sought after, and examined by the mind, and my consciousness will not be dependent on that.\u2019 Thus, you should train.\"</i></p>\n<p>These words penetrated An\u0101thapi\u1e47\u1e0dika\u2019s heart, and with unwavering wisdom, he let go of all attachment. In that very moment, he attained the fruit of non-returner (<i>an\u0101g\u0101m\u012b</i>), transcending worldly rebirth. Shortly thereafter, he passed away and was reborn in the celestial Tusita realm.</p>\n<p>Now appearing as a radiant young deva, he descended to Jetavana Monastery, illuminating the entire grove. With deep reverence, he paid homage to the Blessed One and expressed his realization in inspired verses:</p>\n<p><i>\"Blessed indeed is this Jeta\u2019s Grove,</p>\n<p>Dwelling place of the noble Sangha,</p>\n<p>Wherein abides the King of Dhamma,</p>\n<p>The source of all my happiness.</i></p>\n<p><i>\"Not by birth or wealth alone</p>\n<p>Are beings purified,</p>\n<p>But through wisdom, virtue, and truth\u2014</p>\n<p>These are the paths to liberation.\"</i></p>\n<p><i>\"Thus, the wise who seek true welfare</p>\n<p>Should investigate the Dhamma well,</p>\n<p>Walk the path of purification,</p>\n<p>And free themselves from suffering.\"</i></p>\n<p>Thus, An\u0101thapi\u1e47\u1e0dika\u2019s journey stands as a luminous example of generosity, devotion, and wisdom. From a life of selfless service to final liberation, he exemplified the highest virtues of a lay disciple, inspiring countless generations to follow the path of Dhamma.</p>\n<h3>The Story of Venerable Pu\u1e47\u1e47ik\u0101, Adopted Daughter of An\u0101thapi\u1e47\u1e0dika</h3>\n<p>The <i>Ther\u012bg\u0101th\u0101</i> recounts the inspiring story of Pu\u1e47\u1e47ik\u0101, who was born into servitude in the household of An\u0101thapi\u1e47\u1e0dika. <span id=\"Endnote27\">[<a href=\"#endnote27\">27</a>]</span> In past lives, she had been well-versed in the Dhamma under previous Buddhas, but due to her pride, she was reborn as a slave. Yet, her past merits bore fruit\u2014living in the home of the Buddha\u2019s foremost lay disciple, she frequently accompanied her master and mistress to Jetavana Monastery, where she offered alms and listened to the Blessed One\u2019s teachings.</p>\n<p>One day, upon hearing a profound discourse, her wisdom awakened, her past unwholesome kamma was subdued, and she attained <i>sot\u0101patti</i> (stream-entry). Witnessing her spiritual progress, the compassionate An\u0101thapi\u1e47\u1e0dika did not see her as a mere servant but as a noble being walking the path of liberation. In an extraordinary act of generosity, he freed her from servitude and adopted her as his daughter. He humbly recognized her wisdom, bowing not to status but to the Dhamma itself. Seeing her deep aspiration to renounce worldly life, he escorted her to the Bhikkhun\u012b Sangha, where she became a nun and eventually attained arahantship.</p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page18/image13.png\" />\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>Pu\u1e47\u1e47ik\u0101 challenging the silly rituals of Brahmin Uddaka Sodhaka </b><span id=\"Endnote28\">[<a href=\"#endnote28\">28</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h4><i>Pu\u1e47\u1e47ik\u0101\u2019s Wisdom: The Dialogue with the Brahmin</i></h4>\n<p>Even before her ordination, Pu\u1e47\u1e47ik\u0101\u2019s wisdom shone brightly. One early morning, while fetching water from the river, she encountered a Brahmin named Uddaka Sodhaka, who was shivering as he bathed. She inquired about his daily ritual, and he explained that he sought purification from past misdeeds. With keen insight, Pu\u1e47\u1e47ik\u0101 challenged his belief:</p>\n<p><b>\u201cIf water could cleanse bad deeds, then the fish, turtles, and crocodiles should be the purest beings of all. If rivers could wash away wickedness, would they not also wash away virtue? True purification comes not from bathing but from abandoning unwholesome actions.\u201d</b></p>\n<p>Hearing her wisdom, the Brahmin's delusion shattered. Guided by Pu\u1e47\u1e47ik\u0101, he sought refuge in the Buddha, ordained as a bhikkhu, and eventually attained arahantship.</p>\n<p>An\u0101thapi\u1e47\u1e0dika, ever rejoicing in the spreading of the Dhamma, was deeply pleased by this incident. Recognizing Pu\u1e47\u1e47ik\u0101\u2019s extraordinary wisdom, he supported her path to ordination, leading to her final liberation.</p>\n<h4><i>The Legacy of Generosity and Wisdom</i></h4>\n<p>Pu\u1e47\u1e47ik\u0101\u2019s story beautifully illustrates two great virtues\u2014An\u0101thapi\u1e47\u1e0dika\u2019s boundless generosity and reverence for wisdom, and Pu\u1e47\u1e47ik\u0101\u2019s fearless insight that shattered ignorance. Their lives remind us that true nobility is not found in wealth or status but in selflessness and wisdom. Through her wisdom, Pu\u1e47\u1e47ik\u0101 transformed not only her own destiny but also the lives of those who encountered her, guiding them toward the path of awakening.</p>\n<h2>The Spiritual Path of Vis\u0101kh\u0101: Foremost Laywoman in the Buddha\u2019s Dispensation</h2>\n<p>The scriptures recount numerous teachings imparted to Vis\u0101kh\u0101\u2014Mig\u0101ram\u0101t\u0101\u2014by the Blessed One during his long residence at Pubb\u0101r\u0101ma Monastery in S\u0101vatth\u012b. These discourses covered a vast range of profound subjects that enriched her wisdom and strengthened her resolve on the spiritual path.</p>\n<h3>The Bonds of Sa\u1e43s\u0101ra: Hard to Escape</h3>\n<p>On one occasion, Vis\u0101kh\u0101 found herself entangled in a frustrating matter while dealing with King Pasenadi of Kosala. The outcome did not align with her expectations, leaving her troubled and unsettled. Seeking solace, she turned to the one who dispelled all suffering\u2014the Buddha. With unwavering faith, she entered the monastery, paid homage, and sat before him.</p>\n<p>Seeing her distressed state, the Blessed One gently inquired:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cWell now, Vis\u0101kh\u0101, where have you come from in the middle of the day?\u201d </i>(Ud 2.9)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Grateful for the opportunity to unburden herself before the Compassionate Teacher, Vis\u0101kh\u0101 replied:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cHere, Venerable Sir, I am bound up in an affair with King Pasenadi of Kosala,</p>\n<p>but the King does not conclude the affair according to my desire.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>With profound insight into the nature of worldly entanglements, the Blessed One expounded a brief yet penetrating discourse. He explained how the bonds of sa\u1e43s\u0101ra\u2014whether arising from one\u2019s own actions or from others\u2014inevitably lead to pain and distress. Why? Because one cannot expect others to yield to one\u2019s will, nor can one impose one\u2019s desires upon the world.</p>\n<p>Then, the Buddha uttered this illuminating verse, imbued with timeless wisdom:</p>\n<p><b>\u201cPainful is all subjection,</p>\n<p>Blissful is complete control.</p>\n<p>People are troubled by common concerns,</p>\n<p>Hard to escape are the bonds.\u201d</b></p>\n<p><i>(Sabba\u1e43 paramasa\u1e43 dukkha\u1e43, sabba\u1e43 issariya\u1e43 sukha\u1e43;</p>\n<p>S\u0101dh\u0101ra\u1e47e viha\u00f1\u00f1anti, yog\u0101 hi duratikkam\u0101.)</i></p>\n<p>These profound words struck deep within Vis\u0101kh\u0101\u2019s heart. With wisdom awakened, she realized the futility of clinging to worldly matters and the necessity of inner mastery. Her mind, once troubled, became pacified\u2014another step forward on her noble path to liberation.</p>\n<h2>The Fleeting Joy and Lasting Sorrow of Worldly Attachments</h2>\n<p>Once, while the Blessed One was residing at the Eastern Monastery in Mig\u0101ram\u0101t\u0101\u2019s Mansion near S\u0101vatth\u012b, Vis\u0101kh\u0101 arrived before him, her clothes and hair still wet with grief. Her beloved granddaughter had passed away, and her heart was heavy with sorrow.</p>\n<p>The Buddha, seeing her distress, gently inquired:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cVis\u0101kh\u0101, where have you come from, with wet clothes and hair, in the middle of the day?\u201d</i></p>\n<p>She replied:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cVenerable Sir, my dear granddaughter has died.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>With boundless compassion, the Buddha asked:</p>\n<p><b>\u201c</b><i>Vis\u0101kh\u0101, would you like as many children and grandchildren as there are people in S\u0101vatth\u012b?\u201d</i></p>\n<p>Delighted, she answered:</p>\n<p><b>\u201c</b><i>Yes, Venerable Sir, I would love that.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>The Buddha then posed a profound question:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cHow many people die each day in S\u0101vatth\u012b?\u201d</i></p>\n<p>She reflected and responded:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cPerhaps ten or eight, Venerable Sir.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>The Buddha then revealed the deeper truth:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cIf you had as many children as there are people in S\u0101vatth\u012b, would you ever be without grief?\u201d</i></p>\n<p>In that moment, insight dawned upon Vis\u0101kh\u0101. She realized the weight of worldly attachments and exclaimed:</p>\n<p><b>\u201c</b><i>Enough, Venerable Sir! I see now.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>Then, the Blessed One spoke these profound words:</p>\n<p><b>\u201cFor those who love a hundred, there is a hundredfold suffering,</p>\n<p>For those who love ninety, there is ninetyfold suffering.</p>\n<p>The more attachments one has, the greater the sorrow;</p>\n<p>The less one clings, the lighter the heart.\u201d</b></p>\n<p>And he uttered this timeless verse:</p>\n<p><b>\u201cAll grief, lamentation, and suffering arise from attachment,</p>\n<p>Where there is no attachment, sorrow does not take root.</p>\n<p>Thus, those who seek peace, free from dust and sorrow,</p>\n<p>Should cultivate a heart unattached to the world.\u201d</b></p>\n<p>Already a stream-enterer, Vis\u0101kh\u0101 saw with clarity how deep attachments bring immense suffering. Strengthened in wisdom, she resolved to loosen the bonds of craving and walk the path of true liberation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page18/image14.png\" />\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>Vis\u0101kh\u0101 and family paying homage to the Buddha </b><span id=\"Endnote29\">[<a href=\"#endnote29\">29</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Vis\u0101kh\u0101: A Life of Virtue, Devotion, and Lasting Merit</h3>\n<p>Vis\u0101kh\u0101, the foremost laywoman disciple of the Buddha, lived a life adorned with virtue, wisdom, and boundless generosity. Though she was blessed with immense wealth, she remained humble, kind, and steadfast in her dedication to the Buddha and the Sa\u1e45gha. Her unwavering faith and countless meritorious deeds\u2014providing alms, building monasteries, and guiding others on the path of Dhamma\u2014were not only a source of joy in this life but also secured her a blissful rebirth beyond this world.</p>\n<p>According to tradition, after passing away, Vis\u0101kh\u0101 was reborn among the <b>Nimm\u0101narat\u012b Devas</b>, in the celestial realm of those who delight in creation, as the consort of the deva king Sunimmita. This was the natural fruition of a life spent in selfless service, moral purity, and devotion to the highest truth. Having walked the noble path with diligence, she left behind an inspiring legacy\u2014a testament to the profound happiness that arises from a life well-lived in the Dhamma.<span id=\"Endnote30\">[<a href=\"#endnote30\">30</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Like Vis\u0101kh\u0101, may we too cultivate generosity, wisdom, and unwavering faith in the path of liberation. Whether in great ways or small, may we embody even a fraction of her noble qualities, striving to uplift ourselves and others with kindness, humility, and dedication to the Buddha\u2019s teachings. In doing so, we follow in the footsteps of this great lay disciple, securing both present peace and a future of boundless joy!</p>\n<h2>Advice to King Pasenadi Kosala and Queen Mallika</h2>\n<p>King Pasenadi of Kosala became a devoted follower of the Buddha early in the Blessed One\u2019s ministry and remained a steadfast supporter. His chief queen, Mallika, wise and deeply committed to the Dhamma, often guided the king toward a clearer understanding of the truth. The <i>Kosala Sa\u1e41yutta</i> (SN5) contains numerous suttas recounting their encounters with the Buddha and their progress on the spiritual path. Here, we highlight a key teaching.</p>\n<h3>The Power of Diligence</h3>\n<p>Once, while seated before the Blessed One in S\u0101vatth\u012b, King Pasenadi asked:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cVenerable sir, is there one thing that secures both worldly well-being and spiritual fulfillment?\u201d</i><b> </b><span id=\"Endnote31\">[<a href=\"#endnote31\">31</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Buddha replied:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cIndeed, great king, there is one thing that ensures both prosperity in this life and happiness beyond.\u201d</i></p>\n<p><i>\u201cWhat is that, venerable sir?\u201d</i></p>\n<p>\u201cDiligence, great king. Just as all footprints fit within the footprint of an elephant\u2014declared supreme for its size\u2014so too, diligence is the foundation of all success, both in this world and in the next.\u201d</p>\n<h3>The Blessing of Impartiality</h3>\n<p>Throughout the scriptures, the Buddha exemplifies impartiality, showing boundless compassion for all\u2014rich or poor, man or woman, high-born or low-born. True wisdom transcends social divisions, recognizing the potential for goodness in every being. In the following exchange, the Buddha offers King Pasenadi a profound lesson on impartiality.</p>\n<h4><i>A Daughter\u2019s Worth</i></h4>\n<p>While seated before the Blessed One in S\u0101vatth\u012b, King Pasenadi received whispered news:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cSire, Queen Mallik\u0101 has given birth to a daughter.\u201d</i><b> </b><span id=\"Endnote32\">[<a href=\"#endnote32\">32</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Displeased, the king\u2019s expression darkened. Perceiving his thoughts, the Buddha spoke these verses:</p>\n<p>\u201cO ruler of men, a woman may prove greater than a man.</p>\n<p>She may be wise and virtuous,</p>\n<p>A devoted wife who honours her family.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe son she bears may rise as a hero,</p>\n<p>O lord of the land.</p>\n<p>From such a noble mother,</p>\n<p>A ruler of the realm may be born.\u201d</p>\n<p>Thus, the Buddha gently dispelled the king\u2019s bias, revealing that virtue and greatness are not bound by gender but by the depth of one\u2019s character.</p>\n<p><b>Who is dearer than oneself?</b></p>\n<p>On one occasion King Pasenadi asked Queen Mallika</p>\n<p>\u201cIs there, Mallik\u0101, anyone dearer to you than yourself?\u201d</p>\n<p>There is no one, great king, dearer to me than myself. But is there anyone, great king, more dear</p>\n<p>to you than yourself?\u201d</p>\n<p>The King said:</p>\n<p>\u201cFor me too, Mallik\u0101, there is no one dearer than myself.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mallik\u0101 had been a poor flower girl whom King Pasenadi met by chance after a military defeat. He fell in love with her, married her, and appointed her his chief queen. The king had asked her this question expecting her to say, \u201cYou are dearer to me than myself,\u201d and then to ask him the same question, to which he would have given the same reply, so that they would have strengthened their mutual love. But Mallik\u0101, being wise and learned, answered with complete honesty and the king too had to reply in the same way.</p>\n<p>Later the King approached the Buddha and related what happened, the Blessed One said thus:</p>\n<p>Having traversed all quarters with the mind,</p>\n<p>One finds none anywhere dearer than oneself.</p>\n<p>Likewise, each person holds himself most dear;</p>\n<p>Hence one who loves himself should not harm others.\u201d(SN3: 8)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Who is Dearer Than Oneself?</h3>\n<p>One day, King Pasenadi turned to his beloved Queen Mallik\u0101 and asked:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cMallik\u0101, is there anyone dearer to you than yourself?\u201d</i></p>\n<p>Without hesitation, she replied:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cNo, great king, there is no one dearer to me than myself. But what about you? Is there anyone dearer to you than yourself?\u201d</i></p>\n<p>The king, expecting a different answer, was taken aback but had to admit:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cFor me too, Mallik\u0101, there is no one dearer than myself.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>Queen Mallik\u0101 had once been a humble flower girl whom the king met after a bitter military defeat. Enchanted by her wisdom and grace, he married her and made her his chief queen. On this occasion, he had hoped for a romantic affirmation of their love, but Mallik\u0101, ever wise and truthful, spoke with complete honesty\u2014prompting the king to do the same.</p>\n<p>Later, King Pasenadi recounted this exchange to the Blessed One. The Buddha, revealing a profound truth, declared:</p>\n<p>\u201cHaving searched in all directions,</p>\n<p>One finds none dearer than oneself.</p>\n<p>Just as each person holds themselves most dear,</p>\n<p>So too, one who cherishes themselves should not harm others.\u201d (SN 3:8)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Thus, the Buddha transformed personal love into a universal teaching: true self-care is inseparable from compassion for all beings.</p>\n<h2>Sorrow Arises from Those Who Are Dear</h2>\n<p>While staying in Jetavana Monastery, the Buddha was approached by a grieving householder who had lost his only son. Overcome with sorrow, he lamented:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cSince my son\u2019s death, I have no desire to work or eat. I go to the charnel ground crying, \u2018My only son, where are you?\u2019\u201d</i><span id=\"Endnote33\">[<a href=\"#endnote33\">33</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Seeing his distress, the Buddha gently said:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cSo it is, householder, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair arise from those who are dear.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>The man, expecting comfort rather than wisdom, was displeased and left. When others heard the Buddha\u2019s words, they doubted: <b>\u201cSurely, joy comes from those we love, not sorrow!\u201d</b> Even King Pasenadi, who had not yet established deep faith in the Buddha, questioned the statement when he heard it. But his wise queen, Mallik\u0101, unwavering in her trust, replied simply:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cIf the Blessed One has said it, then it is so.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>The king, irritated by her unwavering faith, dismissed her. However, Queen Mallik\u0101 sought to reveal the truth of the Buddha\u2019s words. She sent a messenger to confirm the teaching, and the</p>\n<p>Buddha affirmed it, illustrating his point with a tragic story:</p>\n<p>A woman, forced by her relatives to leave her husband for another, pleaded with her beloved:</p>\n<p><i>\u2018They are separating us against my will!\u2019</i></p>\n<p>In anguish, her husband, consumed by attachment, committed a terrible act\u2014ending both their lives in the belief that they would reunite in the afterlife.</p>\n<p>The Buddha concluded:</p>\n<p>\u201cSee how sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair arise from those who are dear?\u201d</p>\n<p>When Queen Mallik\u0101 relayed this wisdom to King Pasenadi, she asked:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cSire, is Princess Vaj\u012br\u012b dear to you?\u201d</i></p>\n<p><i>\u201cYes, Mallik\u0101, she is very dear to me.\u201d</i></p>\n<p><i>\u201cWhat if something were to happen to her? Would you not grieve?\u201d</i></p>\n<p>The king fell silent. Then, deeply moved, he realized the truth of the Buddha\u2019s words: attachment inevitably leads to suffering.</p>\n<p>Overcome with reverence, he rose from his seat, joined his hands in respect, and declared three times:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cHonour to the Blessed One, accomplished and fully enlightened!\u201d</i></p>\n<p>Thus, through Queen Mallik\u0101\u2019s wisdom and unwavering faith, the king came to see for himself that the Buddha\u2019s words are always true.</p>\n<h2>The Death of Queen Mallik\u0101 and King Pasenadi</h2>\n<p>When King Pasenadi received the news of Queen Mallik\u0101\u2019s death, grief overwhelmed him. He sat before the Buddha, shoulders slumped, lost in sorrow. <span id=\"Endnote34\">[<a href=\"#endnote34\">34</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Seeing his pain, the Blessed One gently reminded him of an inescapable truth:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cGreat king, there are five things no being\u2014whether ascetic, brahmin, deva, M\u0101ra, or Brahm\u0101\u2014can prevent:</i></p>\n<p>What is subject to old age will grow old.</p>\n<p>What is subject to illness will fall ill.</p>\n<p>What is subject to death will die.</p>\n<p>What is subject to destruction will be destroyed.</p>\n<p>What is subject to loss will be lost.</p>\n<p><b>No sorrow or lamentation can change these truths.</b></p>\n<p>Then, the Buddha spoke in verse:</p>\n<p>\u201cGrief brings no benefit, only joy to one\u2019s enemies.</p>\n<p>The wise remain steady in adversity, unmoved by loss.</p>\n<p>If goodness can be attained, strive for it.</p>\n<p>If not, accept with wisdom: \u2018Kamma is strong; what can I do now?\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>Hearing these words, the king gradually overcame his sorrow, realizing that all worldly things are impermanent.</p>\n<h3>A Teaching for Us Today</h3>\n<p>Like King Pasenadi, we too will face loss\u2014of loved ones, possessions, and even our own health. Clinging to what is fleeting only deepens suffering. The wise recognize impermanence, letting go with understanding rather than despair. Instead of lamenting what cannot be changed, we should cultivate virtue and wisdom\u2014the only treasures that transcend death.</p>\n<p>Thus, may we walk the path with insight, courage, and peace!</p>\n<h3>The Death of King Pasenadi: A Lesson in Impermanence</h3>\n<p>During his travels, King Pasenadi learned that the Buddha was staying nearby and eagerly set out to meet him. Upon arrival, he set aside his royal insignia, humbly bowed at the Blessed One\u2019s feet, and declared his reverence:<span id=\"Endnote35\">[<a href=\"#endnote35\">35</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\u201cVenerable sir, you are enlightened, the Dhamma is well proclaimed, and the Sangha follows the noble path. As a fellow Kosalan and noble, and being of the same age, I feel it is only right to honour you in this way.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>The Buddha, seeing the depth of the king\u2019s faith, encouraged the monks to remember this moment, calling it a <i>monument to the Dhamma</i>.</p>\n<p>Yet soon after, fate turned. Betrayed by his own commander, Pasenadi lost his kingdom to his son, Prince Vi\u1e0d\u016b\u1e0dabha. Seeking refuge in R\u0101jagaha, he arrived at night, only to find the city gates closed. Exhausted and abandoned, the once-mighty ruler\u2014who had commanded armies and ruled vast lands\u2014died in the cold, with only a loyal servant by his side.</p>\n<h4><i>A Message for the Present Generation</i></h4>\n<p>King Pasenadi\u2019s life teaches us an undeniable truth: wealth, power, and status are fleeting. In the end, none of these protected him from impermanence. Though he ruled a mighty kingdom, he departed this world alone, just as any other being must.</p>\n<p>Yet, his deep faith in the Buddha, his generosity, and his wisdom may have secured him a fortunate rebirth, paving the way for his eventual enlightenment.</p>\n<p>For us today, this is a call to reflection: what truly matters in life? Worldly success vanishes, but the virtues we cultivate\u2014faith, wisdom, and compassion\u2014will follow us beyond this life. Instead of chasing impermanent gains, let us invest in what endures: the Dhamma, which leads to true peace and liberation.</p>\n<p>May we walk the path of wisdom, undistracted by fleeting illusions, and strive for the highest refuge\u2014Nibb\u0101na!</p>\n<p>May we walk the path of wisdom, undistracted by fleeting illusions, and strive for the highest refuge\u2014Nibb\u0101na.</p>\n<h3>End Notes: Section 18</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<span id=\"endnote1\">[<a href=\"#Endnote1\">1</a>]</span>\t Source 1: Madhuratthavil\u0101sin\u012b (Buddhava\u1e41satthakath\u0101) of Bhadant\u00e2cariya Buddhadatta Mahathera: Translated by I.

At around seventy-nine years of age, the Blessed One departed from S\u0101vatthi, traveling toward R\u0101jagaha. However, R\u0101jagaha was not his final destination\u2014his journey would ultimately end in Kusin\u0101r\u0101, in the Malla region where the final Parinibbana taken place. The final journey according to the scriptures and tradition is a very long one,<span id=\"Endnote1\">[<a href=\"#endnote1\">1</a>]</span> and in this first phase to reach R\u0101jagaha the Blessed One and his sangha may have walked about 570 km (about 46 yojanas)<span id=\"Endnote2\">[<a href=\"#endnote2\">2</a>]</span> according to the present-day road map given below. <span id=\"Endnote3\">[<a href=\"#endnote3\">3</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page19_1/image1.png\" />\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>First Phase of the Final Journey: S\u0101vatthi, to R\u0101jagaha, Distance about 570 km (46 yojanas) </b><span id=\"Endnote4\">[<a href=\"#endnote4\">4</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><b>Departure from S\u0101vatthi</b></h2>\n<p>According to tradition after completing his 44th rainy season (vassa) at the age of seventy-nine years in S\u0101vatthi (now Shravasti), the Buddha travelled his final journey to R\u0101jagaha. The scriptures do not clearly describe how the journey from S\u0101vatthi began, so we must rely on tradition and other sources to bridge this gap.</p>\n<p><i>\u201c The Buddha observed regular Rains Retreats from the 21</i><i><sup>st</sup></i><i>\u00a0to the 44</i><i><sup>th</sup></i><i>\u00a0year at Jetavana and Pubb\u0101r\u0101ma monasteries at S\u0101vatth\u012b, in the Kosala country, which served as his alms resort.</i></p>\n<p><i>Then the Buddha spent his last Rains Retreat, the 45</i><i><sup>th</sup></i><i>\u00a0in the village of Ve\u1e37uva, in Ves\u0101l\u012b country, when on the verge of his Parinibb\u0101na\u201d</i><span id=\"Endnote5\">[<a href=\"#endnote5\">5</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In Section 18, we saw that the Blessed One spent nearly twenty vassas in S\u0101vatthi, residing at times in Jetavana Monastery and at other times in Pubb\u0101r\u0101ma Monastery. In between, he travelled to various regions to spread the Dhamma for the welfare and benefit of many. During this period, his foremost lay supporter An\u0101thapi\u1e47\u1e0dika<b> </b>passed away, having made progress on the path (see Section 18). Among other prominent figures of that time who were ardent supporters of the Buddha \u2014Queen Mallik\u0101 and King Pasenadi also died. The <i>Dhammachetiya Sutta</i> (MN: 89) records the final encounter of King Pasenadi with the Blessed One:</p>\n<p>\"<i>Again, Venerable Sir, the Blessed One is a noble, and I am a noble; the Blessed One is a Kosalan, and I am a Kosalan; the Blessed One is eighty years old, and I am eighty years old. Since that is so, I think it proper to offer such supreme honour to the Blessed One and to express such friendship.\"</i></p>\n<p>From this statement, we can infer that the Buddha was approximately 79 years old at the time (though the king said that he was 80 years!) Since he spent his final vassa\u2014the 45th\u2014in Ves\u0101li, it suggests he was 80 at that point, having spent the 44th vassa at the age of 79 in S\u0101vatthi.</p>\n<p>According to tradition, after completing his 44th rainy retreat at Jetavana Monastery, the Buddha, accompanied by a large number of bhikkhus, departed from S\u0101vatthi and began his journey toward R\u0101jagaha. During the Buddha\u2019s time, the rainy season retreat (<i>Vassa</i>) typically began on the \u0100s\u0101\u1e37ha full moon day (June/July) and lasted three to four months, ending around the Kattika full moon day (October/November). Based on this timeline, we can assume that he left S\u0101vatthi around mid-November.</p>\n<h2>The Possible Route from S\u0101vatthi to R\u0101jagaha: The First Phase of the Buddha\u2019s Final Journey</h2>\n<p>There is no definitive record in the Scriptures, Commentaries, or ancient maps detailing the precise route the Blessed One took when he left S\u0101vatthi for R\u0101jagaha at the beginning of his final journey. However, to support this presentation and bridge the narrative between these two major events\u2014his departure from S\u0101vatthi and his arrival in R\u0101jagaha\u2014we have constructed a plausible route. This reconstruction is based on geographical continuity, historical trade paths, proximity to rivers, and references to places the Buddha is known to have visited in various discourses\u2014whether during this journey or earlier ones.</p>\n<p>We acknowledge this proposed route is speculative and does not claim canonical authority. Its purpose is to offer a coherent and contextually supported narrative that helps visualize the first phase of the Buddha\u2019s final journey from S\u0101vatthi to R\u0101jagaha before continuing toward Kusin\u0101r\u0101.</p>\n<p><b>The route proceeds as follows (see map below for reference):</b></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Possible Route:</p>\n<p><b>S\u0101vatthi \u2192 Gonda \u2192 S\u0101keta \u2192 Sultanpur \u2192 Azamgarh \u2192 Ballia \u2192 Chapra \u2192 Ukk\u0101cal\u0101 \u2192 P\u0101\u1e6dalig\u0101ma \u2192 R\u0101jagaha.</b></p>\n<h3>General Overview of the Route</h3>\n<p>From <b>S\u0101vatthi,</b> the path likely followed the River Aciravat\u012b (now known as the Rapti) southward to <b>Gonda</b> (49 km), then further to <b>S\u0101keta </b>(Ayodhya), situated on the Ghaghara River. In ancient times, major roads often ran parallel to rivers, which provided water, fertile lands, and natural paths for travel. From S\u0101keta, the journey may have continued southeast along the Ghaghara to <b>Sultanpur </b>(possibly ancient Kus\u0101vat\u012b), then onward to <b>Azamgarh </b>(139 km from Sultanpur), and further to <b>Ballia</b> (111 km southeast)\u2014the eastern boundary of Kosala and entry into Magadha.</p>\n<p>From <b>Ballia,</b> the Blessed One and his monks may have reached <b>Chapra</b> (70 km east), located at the confluence of the Ghaghara and Ganges Rivers. Although we cannot determine precisely how the Sangha crossed the Ghaghara here, it is conceivable that during the dry season the river was shallow enough to wade across, especially at a narrow point (as suggested by modern sources <span id=\"Endnote6\">[<a href=\"#endnote6\">6</a>]</span>).</p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page19_1/image2.png\" />\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>Map1: The Final Journey of the Buddha: First Phase </b><span id=\"Endnote7\">[<a href=\"#endnote7\">7</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>From <b>Chapra</b>, the path likely continued east along the Ganges\u2019 north bank, possibly crossing the Gandhak River to reach <b>Ukk\u0101cal\u0101 (</b>modern Hajipur). From there, they may have crossed the Ganges to arrive at <b>P\u0101\u1e6dalig\u0101ma </b>(modern Patna), and then proceeded to <b>R\u0101jagaha</b>\u2014completing the first leg of this long journey, spanning an estimated 570 km or more. Below is a more detailed look at the major points along this possible route:</p>\n<h3>S\u0101vatthi \u2013 The Departure Point</h3>\n<p>S\u0101vatthi, situated on the west bank of the River Aciravat\u012b (Rapti), <span id=\"Endnote8\">[<a href=\"#endnote8\">8</a>]</span> is mentioned frequently in the P\u0101li Canon (e.g., AN 6.62, AN 7.66, AN 8.19, AN 10.15). It was one of the principal cities where the Buddha resided and taught. From here, the Sangha may have begun traveling south along the riverbank.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page19_1/image3.png\" />\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>Buddhist monument in S\u0101vatthi </b><span id=\"Endnote9\">[<a href=\"#endnote9\">9</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page19_1/image4.jpeg\" />\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>Modern day picture of Rapti River (then River Aciravat\u012b) </b><span id=\"Endnote10\">[<a href=\"#endnote10\">10</a>]</span><b> </b>(According to the Scriptures, the Buddha Often Walked Along the Banks of the River Aciravat\u012b While Residing in S\u0101vatth\u012b)</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Gonda \u2013 A Logical Stop</h3>\n<p>Gonda, about 49 km south of S\u0101vatthi, was historically part of Uttara Kosala and sits near a tributary of the Ghaghara River.<span id=\"Endnote11\">[<a href=\"#endnote11\">11</a>]</span> While no specific Buddhist sites have been identified in Gonda itself, its proximity to major centres of early Buddhism and its role as an agricultural and trade hub suggest it may have been part of the Buddha\u2019s journey.

His disciples S\u0101riputta, Mah\u0101moggall\u0101na, and Anuruddha also stayed in nearby groves (SN 52.4\u20136). The commentaries record that Vis\u0101kh\u0101\u2019s parents moved here from Bhaddiya with royal permission, and her father, the wealthy merchant Dhana\u00f1jaya, played a key role in the city\u2019s prosperity (see Section 18).</p>\n<p>Strategically located at the intersection of major trade routes\u2014north-south (S\u0101vatthi\u2013Prati\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101na) and east-west (R\u0101jagaha\u2013V\u0101r\u0101\u1e47as\u012b\u2013S\u0101vatthi\u2013Tak\u1e63a\u015bil\u0101)\u2014S\u0101keta likely had the infrastructure and devotion to welcome the Buddha and the Sangha during their travels.</p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page19_1/image6.png\" />\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>Statue of a Buddha excavated in Ayodhya </b><span id=\"Endnote15\">[<a href=\"#endnote15\">15</a>]</span><b> </b></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page19_1/image7.jpeg\" />\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>Modern day picture of Ayodhya located on the banks of the Saryu River </b><span id=\"Endnote16\">[<a href=\"#endnote16\">16</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Dhamma delivered at S\u0101keta</h3>\n<p>Though not explicitly linked to the Blessed One\u2019s final journey, a few profound discourses given at S\u0101keta beautifully illustrates his presence there. We have presented the following:</p>\n<p><i>Five spiritual faculties and their transformation into the five powers</i></p>\n<p>While residing in the A\u00f1jana Grove in the Deer Park, the Buddha taught the bhikkhus about the five spiritual faculties and their transformation into the five powers.<span id=\"Endnote17\">[<a href=\"#endnote17\">17</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom\u2014these qualities, when developed, serve both as faculties that guide and as powers that protect. The Buddha emphasized that there is no real difference between them; they are like a river flowing around an island\u2014seen as one stream or two, depending on the perspective. The essence remains the same.</p>\n<p>Through steadfast cultivation of these five strengths, a noble disciple is capable of breaking the bonds of ignorance and attaining liberation\u2014right here, in this very life.</p>\n<p>Faith becomes a power when it is unwavering.</p>\n<p>Energy becomes a power when it is tireless.</p>\n<p>Mindfulness becomes a power when it is steady.</p>\n<p>Samadhi becomes a power when it is undisturbed.</p>\n<p>Wisdom becomes a power when it sees clearly and deeply.</p>\n<p>This inspiring teaching reminds us: the path is not far. It begins with trust, effort, awareness, clarity, and insight\u2014unshaken, unwavering, and luminous.</p>\n<h4><i>What leads to true knowledge and liberation</i></h4>\n<p>One day, while the Blessed One was residing in the Deer Park at A\u00f1jana Grove in S\u0101keta, the wanderer Ku\u1e47\u1e0daliya approached, exchanged greetings, and asked: <span id=\"Endnote18\">[<a href=\"#endnote18\">18</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"Master Gotama, I see ascetics debating to defend their views. But for what benefit does the Tath\u0101gata live?\"</p>\n<p>\"<b>The Tath\u0101gata lives for the benefit of true knowledge and liberation</b>,\" the Blessed One replied.</p>\n<p>Ku\u1e47\u1e0daliya then inquired what leads to true knowledge and liberation. The Buddha explained that the seven factors of enlightenment, cultivated, bring about true knowledge and liberation. These factors are fulfilled through the four establishments of mindfulness, which arise from the three kinds of good conduct\u2014bodily, verbal, and mental. Good conduct, in turn, depends on restraint of the senses, which is achieved when a bhikkhu remains unattached to pleasant and unpleasant sensory experiences, free from longing and ill will.</p>\n<p>The Buddha further explained how each step nourishes the next: mindfulness develops the factors of enlightenment, which lead to liberation. Upon hearing this, Ku\u1e47\u1e0daliya was deeply moved and declared:</p>\n<p>\"Magnificent, Master Gotama! You have illuminated the Dhamma as one who sets upright what was overturned, reveals what was hidden, and holds up a lamp for those in darkness. From today, I go for refuge to the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sa\u1e45gha for life.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page19_1/image8.jpeg\" />\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>Modern day picture of Gomti River-Bridge Crossing from the city of Sultanpur </b><span id=\"Endnote19\">[<a href=\"#endnote19\">19</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Sultanpur (Kushavat\u012b)\u2014An Ancient Location</h3>\n<p>Located on the banks of the Gomti River (also known as Gumti), a tributary of the Ganges, Sultanpur in present-day Uttar Pradesh could have been another possible stop on the Buddha\u2019s southward journey from Ayodhya.

For example, nearby Chirand\u2014just 10 km east of Chhapra\u2014is an important archaeological site. Excavations there have revealed continuous human habitation from the Neolithic period (around 2500 BCE) through the Chalcolithic and Iron Age, up to around 30 CE.  <span id=\"Endnote33\">[<a href=\"#endnote33\">33</a>]</span></p>\n<p>Chhapra is also home to a sacred site called \u2018Gautam Sth\u0101n\u2019\u2014\u201cPlace of Gotama\u201d\u2014though this is not a Buddhist site. <span id=\"Endnote34\">[<a href=\"#endnote34\">34</a>]</span>.  Nevertheless, its name evokes the memory of the Buddha and suggests that the area may have preserved traces of his legacy. Given Chhapra\u2019s location between key Buddhist centres such as P\u0101talig\u0101ma (modern Patna) and Bodhgay\u0101, and its position along important trade and travel routes, it is plausible that the Buddha passed through or near this area during his final journey, continuing to share the Dhamma for the benefit of the many.</p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page19_1/image15.jpeg\" />\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>India\u2019s longest multi-span Extradosed Bridge, 4.35 Km -across the Ganges  connecting Ara-Chhapra in Bhojpur, Bihar</b><span id=\"Endnote35\">[<a href=\"#endnote35\">35</a>]</span><b></p>\n<p></b></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page19_1/image16.png\" />\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>Gautam Sthan at Revelganj is situated on the bank of the holy river Saryu or Ghaghara 8 kilometres west of Chapra, Bihar, India.</b><span id=\"Endnote36\">[<a href=\"#endnote36\">36</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page19_1/image17.png\" />\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>Present day road map from Chapra, Bihar to Hajipur in Bihar (about 57 km) </b><span id=\"Endnote37\">[<a href=\"#endnote37\">37</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page19_1/image18.png\" />\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>The Buddha walking with large number of Bhiikhus along the River Ganges: From Saran to Ukkacala 57 km (4.6 Yojanas) </b><span id=\"Endnote38\">[<a href=\"#endnote38\">38</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Ukkacala (Hajipur) \u2014Key Crossing Point of Ganges</h3>\n<p>From Chapra, the Blessed One and his Sangha may have journeyed eastward along the serene northern bank of the Ganges River, covering approximately 57 kilometres (about 4.6 yojanas), likely progressing at the customary pace of one yojana per day.

This, the Buddha explained, is like those recluses and brahmins who are unskilled in understanding this world and the next, the realm of M\u0101ra and what lies beyond death. Following such teachers leads to confusion and harm.</p>\n<p>In contrast, the <b>wise cowherd</b>, after carefully surveying both shores, led his herd across a safe ford. He guided the strong bulls first, followed by the others in order of strength, until even the weakest calf, urged by its mother, safely reached the far shore. This, said the Blessed One, is like the Noble Ones\u2014those fully awakened, those on the path, and those with faith\u2014each progressing toward the further shore of liberation according to their spiritual maturity.</p>\n<p>The Buddha concluded:</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Just as the wise cowherd brought all to safety, so too, one who is skilled in the world and the Dhamma leads others toward the deathless.

This was no ordinary village. The scriptures speak of a place graced by the presence of many devoted lay disciples who held the Dhamma close to their hearts. In such an environment, filled with faith and reverence, it is only natural to imagine the Blessed One being received with offerings, humility, and heartfelt joy.</p>\n<p>It is likely that the Buddha and his disciples paused here, resting amidst the warmth of the community\u2014perhaps under the shade of trees or within humble dwellings offered by faithful householders. Their presence would have sanctified the land, turning the simple village into a sacred space of refuge and inspiration.</p>\n<p>This moment in P\u0101\u1e6dalig\u0101ma marks not just a stop along the Buddha\u2019s final journey, but also a quiet affirmation of how deeply the Dhamma had taken root in the hearts of the people.

Nevertheless, in and around the city, there are several places dedicated to Buddhism.

If we imagine the Blessed One and the noble Sangha walking gently at a steady pace of one yojana per day, the journey would have taken about eight or nine days, winding through the heart of Magadha, with each step echoing the rhythms of a life lived in harmony with Dhamma.</p>\n<p>The scriptures are largely silent about this specific episode\u2014the return of the Blessed One to R\u0101jagaha after a long absence. As earlier noted, (in Section 18), the Buddha had spent nearly twenty vassas in and around S\u0101vatth\u012b, and there is no recorded mention of him visiting R\u0101jagaha during that period. The 17th vassa, spent in Magadha, seems to be the last known rainy season near R\u0101jagaha before the final vassa (the 45th) at Ves\u0101l\u012b.</p>\n<p>Yet, in this silence, we sense a deeper movement: the Buddha walking steadily back toward the city where his early ministry had once flourished\u2014where kings, ministers, householders, and recluses had once gathered to hear the Dhamma. The path to R\u0101jagaha was not just a return to a city, but perhaps, a compassionate return to hearts in need of healing.</p>\n<p>In the S\u0101ma\u00f1\u00f1aphala Sutta (DN: 2), we encounter a poignant moment. The Blessed One is staying at the Mango Grove of <i>J\u012bvaka Kom\u0101rabhacca</i>, just outside R\u0101jagaha. It is here that King <i>Aj\u0101tasattu</i>, the son of the late King Bimbis\u0101ra, comes to meet him\u2014accompanied by his royal entourage and the devoted physician J\u012bvaka.</p>\n<p>The king, not recognizing the Buddha, asks quietly, <i>\u201cWhere is the Lord?\u201d</i></p>\n<p>And J\u012bvaka, with reverence, replies, <i>\u201cThat is the Lord, Sire\u2014seated there against the central pillar, surrounded by the noble Sangha.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>This was not merely a royal visit. It was a return of conscience, a moment of reckoning. Aj\u0101tasattu, once misled by the evil counsel of Venerable Devadatta, had committed grievous acts, including the murder of his own father. And yet, here he was\u2014seeking wisdom, forgiveness, and perhaps, redemption.</p>\n<p>With infinite compassion, the Blessed One does not condemn him, but gently leads him to a truth that shines like a beacon through the fog of delusion. In response to the king\u2019s question about whether there is any tangible fruit of the renunciate life, the Buddha unfolds a teaching that starts with the transformation of a slave into a recluse\u2014one who, through self-restraint and virtue, becomes worthy of honour from even the highest in society.</p>\n<p>And then, with sublime patience, the Buddha continues to reveal the higher fruits of the homeless life: peace, contentment, meditative joy, and ultimately, the supreme fruit\u2014Nibb\u0101na, the end of all suffering.</p>\n<p>So powerful was this discourse that the king, deeply moved, declared himself a lay follower of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. In a moment of honest self-reflection, he confessed:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cLord, transgression overcame me\u2026 in that I, for the sake of the throne, deprived my father, that good man and just king, of his life. May the Blessed One accept my confession, that I may restrain myself in the future.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>The Buddha accepted his confession, affirming a profound truth:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cHe who acknowledges his transgression as such and confesses it for betterment in future, will grow in the Ariyan discipline.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>Yet, the Buddha later told the monks that had it not been for that unwholesome act of patricide, King Aj\u0101tasattu would have attained Stream-entry, opening the Dhamma-eye then and there.</p>\n<h3>A Living Lesson from the Path</h3>\n<p>This deeply moving episode reveals something timeless: the Dhamma always points the right way. Even amidst past wrongdoings, confusion, and sorrow, the Dhamma offers a path forward\u2014a way of truth, transformation, and liberation. Where greed, hatred, and delusion lie in wait to trap us, the Dhamma teaches restraint, clarity, and compassion.</p>\n<p>The Blessed One did not force his truth upon anyone. He waited until the time was ripe, until the heart of a once-deluded king turned toward light\u2014and then, with great kindness, he opened the way.</p>\n<p>This is the nature of the Dhamma. It does not punish\u2014it purifies. It does not judge\u2014it guides. And no matter how far one has strayed, as long as there is sincerity and a turning of the heart, the Dhamma is always ready to lead us gently home.</p>\n<p>Therefore, dear reader, walk with the same gentle footsteps that many devotees once followed the Blessed One\u2014each word of Dhamma you reflect, each reflection you share with the fellow beings is like offering a fragrant lotus at the feet of the Buddha.</p>\n<p>With this reflection, we conclude this section. The next section (19-2) will focus on the events that unfolded in R\u0101jagaha during the Buddha\u2019s final visit to that ancient capital of Magadha Kingdom.</p>\n<p><b>End Notes: Section 19-1</b></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<span id=\"endnote1\">[<a href=\"#Endnote1\">1</a>]</span>\t According to Mahaparinibbana sutta: DN:16.\n<p></p>\n<span id=\"endnote2\">[<a href=\"#Endnote2\">2</a>]</span>\t Source: https://www.unitsmash.com/converters/length/kilometer/to/yojana/570\n<p></p>\n<span id=\"endnote3\">[<a href=\"#Endnote3\">3</a>]</span>\t Google map\n<p></p>\n<span id=\"endnote4\">[<a href=\"#Endnote4\">4</a>]</span>\t Ibid.\n<p></p>\n<span id=\"endnote5\">[<a href=\"#Endnote5\">5</a>]</span>\t Source: The Great Chronicles of the Buddhas by Mingun Say\u0101daw: revised and re-edited by\n<p>\u0100nandajoti Bhikkhu: https://ancient-buddhist-texts.net/English-Texts/Great-Chronicles/index.htm</p>\n<p></p>\n<span id=\"endnote6\">[<a href=\"#Endnote6\">6</a>]</span>\t Source: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Rapti_River\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Rapti_River</a>\n<p></p>\n<span id=\"endnote7\">[<a href=\"#Endnote7\">7</a>]</span>\t Route indicated on the Map by : https://wiswo.org/books/footprints/\n<p></p>\n<span id=\"endnote8\">[<a href=\"#Endnote8\">8</a>]</span>\t Source: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Rapti_River\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Rapti_River</a>\n<p></p>\n<span id=\"endnote9\">[<a href=\"#Endnote9\">9</a>]</span>\t Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shravasti\n<p></p>\n<span id=\"endnote10\">[<a href=\"#Endnote10\">10</a>]</span>\t Source: https://stock.adobe.com/search/images?k=%22rapti%20river%22\n<p></p>\n<span id=\"endnote11\">[<a href=\"#Endnote11\">11</a>]</span>\t Gonda, city is located in east-central\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/place/Uttar-Pradesh\"><u>Uttar Pradesh</u></a>\u00a0state, northern\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/place/India\"><u>India</u></a>.

19-2: Final Journey of the Buddha \u2013 Phase 2: Spending Time in R\u0101jagaha</b></p>\n<p>In the previous section (19-1), we followed the Blessed One and his venerable Sangha as they arrived at the serene Mango Grove of J\u012bvaka, nestled on the outskirts of the ancient city of R\u0101jagaha. This marked the end of a long and purposeful journey from S\u0101vatthi, undertaken with steadfast resolve and boundless compassion.</p>\n<p>According to the <i>S\u0101ma\u00f1\u00f1aphala Sutta</i> (DN 2), the Buddha was residing in the mango grove of J\u012bvaka Kom\u0101rabhacca, accompanied by a great assembly of monks\u2014some twelve hundred and fifty in number. This may well have been the faithful retinue who journeyed with him from S\u0101vatthi, or perhaps their numbers swelled along the way, as others joined the Blessed One, inspired by his presence and drawn by the fragrance of the Dhamma he shared along the path.</p>\n<p>In Phase 1 of this final journey, the Buddha and his disciples are believed to have walked approximately 570 kilometres (about 46 yojanas) to reach R\u0101jagaha. Having completed his 44th vassa in S\u0101vatthi, it is likely that the Buddha set out on this pilgrimage around mid-November\u2014a time traditionally chosen for long travels following the conclusion of the rains retreat.</p>\n<p>Following the ancient rhythm of a yojana a day, it is reasonable to estimate that the journey would have taken about 46 days. Allowing for pauses to rest, teach, or offer compassion to those in need, it may have extended to nearly 12 weeks, or about 48 days. In this light, we may envision the Blessed One entering R\u0101jagaha around mid-February, during the lunar month of Phaggu\u1e47a\u2014a time when the land begins to warm, and the air stirs with the promise of change. Thus began the second phase of the Buddha\u2019s final journey\u2014a sacred pause in the holy city of R\u0101jagaha, where many teachings had been given and where his presence would once again grace the hearts of devotees and seekers alike.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page19_2/image77.png\" />\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>Jeevaka\u2019s Mango Grove in ancient R\u0101jagaha </b><span id=\"Endnote5\">[<a href=\"#endnote5\">5</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><b>Moving from J\u012bvaka\u2019s Mango Grove to Vulture Peak in R\u0101jagaha</b></h2>\n<p>Having arrived in R\u0101jagaha, the Blessed One and the venerable Sangha initially stayed at the peaceful mango grove of J\u012bvaka Kom\u0101rabhacca\u2014known in the tradition as <i>J\u012bvakar\u0101ma Vih\u0101ra</i>. This sacred grove, located just outside the bustling city of R\u0101jagaha (modern-day Rajgir), held a special place in the Buddha\u2019s journey.

The king, though mighty in worldly affairs, had tasted the Dhamma and begun to recognize the value of spiritual guidance. As he planned to wage war against the Vajjians\u2014a confederacy across the Ganges\u2014he turned not to his army, but to the Blessed One. What followed was not a command or permission, but a timeless teaching on the foundations of a flourishing society.</p>\n<h3>The King\u2019s Messenger</h3>\n<p>Wishing to act wisely, King Aj\u0101tasattu summoned his chief minister, the Brahmin Vassak\u0101ra, and instructed him:</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Go to the Blessed Lord\u2026 and say: \u2018Lord, King Aj\u0101tasattu of Magadha wishes to attack the Vajjians. Whatever the Lord declares to you, report that faithfully back to me, for Tath\u0101gatas never lie.\u2019\u201d</i></p>\n<p>Respectfully, Vassak\u0101ra travelled from R\u0101jagaha to Gijjhak\u016b\u1e6da, worshipped the Blessed One, and delivered the king\u2019s message. At that moment, the Buddha did not respond directly to the prospect of war. Instead, with Venerable \u0100nanda by his side, he offered a teaching rich with insight.</p>\n<h3><b>The Seven Principles of Non-Decline</b></h3>\n<p>Turning to \u0100nanda, the Buddha asked a series of questions about the Vajjians' conduct and customs:</p>\n<p>- Do the Vajjians meet regularly and in harmony?</p>\n<p>- Do they follow their ancient traditions?</p>\n<p>- Do they respect their elders?</p>\n<p>- Do they protect the virtue of women?</p>\n<p>- Do they honour their shrines?</p>\n<p>- Do they ensure safety for the Arahants and noble ones?</p>\n<p>To each, \u0100nanda replied, \u201cYes, Lord.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Blessed One then declared:</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>As long as the Vajjians uphold these principles, they may be expected to prosper and not decline.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>He added that he had once taught these very principles to the Vajjians at the S\u0101randada Shrine in Ves\u0101l\u012b. (see section 15-1)</p>\n<h3><b>The Buddha\u2019s Silent Counsel</b></h3>\n<p>Though the Buddha never directly told the king not to attack, his message was clear. Strength is not built through conquest, but through harmony, virtue, and wise governance. The true power of a nation\u2014or a community\u2014lies in its commitment to Dhamma.</p>\n<h3><b>Reflections: Lessons for Our Time</b></h3>\n<p>This discourse from Gijjhak\u016b\u1e6da remains deeply relevant today. Whether in families, communities, or countries, the seven principles of non-decline remind us that lasting well-being arises from moral integrity, respect, and unity. Even a king, stirred by worldly ambition, paused to hear the voice of the Dhamma.</p>\n<p>May we, too, look to such wisdom in moments of decision, and may the light of the Blessed One continue to guide all who seek the path of peace.</p>\n<h2>Significant Teachings to the Sangha: Factors of Non-Decline (Aparih\u0101niy\u0101 Dhamma)</h2>\n<p>While dwelling at Gijjhak\u016b\u1e6da, the Blessed One, out of boundless compassion for his disciples, delivered a timeless teaching\u2014guiding the Sangha on how to remain steadfast and flourish on the Noble Path.<span id=\"Endnote8\">[<a href=\"#endnote8\">8</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Seven Factors Conducive to Welfare</h3>\n<p>The Buddha declared that as long as the monks:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1)\tHold regular and frequent assemblies,</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2)\tMeet and conduct their affairs in harmony,</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>3)\tUphold the Vinaya without introducing unauthorized changes,</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>4)\tHonor and respect their elders in the holy life,</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>5)\tGuard themselves against sensual craving,</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>6)\tAre devoted to forest dwellings, and</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>7)\tMaintain mindfulness, welcoming the good and being a refuge to others\u2014</p>\n<p>They can be expected to prosper and not decline.</p>\n<h3>Further Safeguards for Spiritual Welfare</h3>\n<p>He further encouraged the Sangha to cultivate Seven Inner Qualities That Sustain the Path</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\tUnwavering <b>faith</b> (saddh\u0101),</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\tHumble <b>modesty</b> (hir\u012b),</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\tFear of wrongdoing (<b>ottappa</b>),</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\t<b>Dhamma learning</b>,</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\tEnergetic <b>vigour</b> (viriya),</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\tSteady <b>mindfulness</b> (sati), and</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\tPenetrative <b>wisdom</b> (pa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101).</p>\n<h3>Foundations for Harmony and Communal Strength</h3>\n<p>The Buddha also emphasized six qualities that preserve communal harmony:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\tRadiating loving-kindness in body, speech, and thought, both publicly and privately,</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\tSharing righteously gained offerings with fellow virtuous monks,</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\tKeeping to unbroken, liberating discipline cherished by the wise,</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\tRemaining steadfast in such discipline with others,</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\tUpholding the noble view that leads to liberation,</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\tMaintaining that view together with one\u2019s companions, in public and in private.</p>\n<p>These six practices would uphold unity in the monastic community</p>\n<h3>Further Deepening the Path</h3>\n<p>He urged the cultivation of the <b>Seven Factors of Enlightenment (Bojjha\u1e45gas)</b> and the <b>Seven Perceptions</b>: of impermanence, non-self, impurity, danger, overcoming, dispassion, and cessation.</p>\n<p>These teachings are a timeless light for the Sangha\u2014a safeguard, a compass, and a source of inner strength for those who walk the path of Dhamma. The teachings, rich with compassion and clarity, continue to serve as the foundation for the Sangha\u2019s welfare. They are a legacy of wisdom, offering both protection from decline and a clear path toward liberation.</p>\n<h2>Departing from Gijjhak\u016b\u1e6da: The Beginning of the Final Journey North</h2>\n<p>Although we earlier noted that the first phase of the Blessed One\u2019s final journey began in S\u0101vatthi\u2014the very cradle of Buddhism\u2014ending in R\u0101jagaha, the city where countless teachings were delivered and where the late King Bimbis\u0101ra and his followers became devoted supporters of the Buddha and the Sa\u1e45gha, the <i>Mah\u0101parinibb\u0101na Sutta</i> (DN 16) marks a deeper and more poignant transition.</p>\n<p>According to this revered discourse, the ultimate and sacred journey toward the <i>Mah\u0101parinibb\u0101na</i>\u2014the Great Passing Away\u2014begins not in S\u0101vatthi, but at Gijjhak\u016b\u1e6da (Vulture\u2019s Peak), one of the most cherished places where the Blessed One often stayed and shared profound Dhamma teachings with his disciples.</p>\n<p>The Sutta records:</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd when the Lord had stayed at R\u0101jagaha as long as he wished, he said to the Venerable \u0100nanda: \u2018<i>Come, \u0100nanda, let us go to Ambala\u1e6d\u1e6dhik\u0101.\u2019</i></p>\n<p>\u2018<i>Very good, Lord,\u2019 said \u0100nanda,</i> and the Lord went there with a large company of monks.\u201d</p>\n<p>With these simple, gentle words begins the second and final phase of the Tath\u0101gata\u2019s earthly journey\u2014a journey that would ultimately lead to the serene grove of Kusin\u0101r\u0101, the capital of the Malla Republic, where his body would find its final resting place beneath the twin s\u0101la trees.</p>\n<p>To guide our reflection and visualization of this profound path, we refer to the detailed map created by the distinguished Buddhist scholar Bhikkhu \u0100nandajoti, presented below.

Described as a royal park adorned with a rest-house (<i>r\u0101j\u0101g\u0101raka</i>), Ambala\u1e6d\u1e6dhik\u0101 served as a cherished retreat where the Blessed One and his disciples often paused during their travels. <span id=\"Endnote25\">[<a href=\"#endnote25\">25</a>]</span> The place gained special prominence when the Buddha delivered the profound <i>Brahmaj\u0101la Sutta</i> (DN:1)  here\u2014an extraordinary teaching setting forth the broad net of views, and the path that leads beyond all of them.</p>\n<p>The name <i>Ambala\u1e6d\u1e6dhik\u0101</i>, meaning \u201cthe Mango Sapling,\u201d is said to have come from a young mango tree that stood near the park\u2019s gate, offering shade and beauty. Protected by a rampart and adorned with artistic paintings for royal enjoyment, the site was more than a mere park\u2014it was a sanctuary for stillness and insight. Later commentaries describe it not merely as a pleasance, but as a kind of <i>p\u0101s\u0101da</i>\u2014a meditation hall (<i>padh\u0101naghara</i>)\u2014on the outskirts of <i>Veluvana Vih\u0101ra</i>, designed for those devoted to solitude and meditative striving.</p>\n<p>It was here, at this quiet and inspiring place, that the Buddha delivered the <i>Ambala\u1e6d\u1e6dhik\u0101-R\u0101hulov\u0101da Sutta</i> (MN:61) to his son, the young <i>Venerable R\u0101hula</i>, shortly after his ordination. In it, the Buddha gently taught the foundations of mindfulness and ethical reflection\u2014teachings that would form the roots of R\u0101hula's spiritual growth.</p>\n<p>According to the present-day geography, the town of <i>Silao</i>, located about 7\u20138 kilometres between <i>Rajgir</i> and <i>Nalanda</i>, may correspond to this ancient resting place. Though definitive archaeological evidence of Buddhist monuments has not yet emerged from the site, its strategic location on the ancient road strongly suggests that <i>Ambala\u1e6d\u1e6dhik\u0101</i> may have stood nearby. If so, this would have been the natural first stop for the Blessed One and the Sangha, as they made their northward journey\u2014pausing here for rest, reflection, and Dhamma.</p>\n<h2>The Final Teaching at Ambala\u1e6d\u1e6dhik\u0101: A Flame of Compassion</h2>\n<p>During his last journey, as recorded in the <i>Mah\u0101parinibb\u0101na Sutta</i> (DN 16), the Buddha again stayed at Ambala\u1e6d\u1e6dhik\u0101, and here he offered a deeply moving teaching\u2014one that distils the essence of the path:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cThis is morality, this is concentration (Samadhi), this is wisdom.</p>\n<p>Morality, when fulfilled, brings great fruit and benefit.</p>\n<p>Concentration, when fulfilled, brings great fruit and benefit.</p>\n<p>Wisdom, when fulfilled, brings great fruit and benefit.</p>\n<p>The mind imbued with wisdom is fully liberated from the taints\u2014</p>\n<p>the taint of sensuality, the taint of becoming, the taint of false views, and the taint of ignorance.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>In these precious words, we glimpse the Buddha\u2019s unwavering compassion. Though his body had grown old and frail, his heart remained vast and vibrant. Fully aware that time was short, he continued to nurture his disciples\u2014urging them to deepen their practice, to contemplate, to strive with urgency. Many, including <i>Venerable \u0100nanda</i>, had not yet reached the final goal. And so, again and again, he emphasized the path: S\u012bla, Sam\u0101dhi, Pa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u2014the threefold training that leads beyond sorrow, beyond bondage, to unshakable peace.</p>\n<p>Even in the twilight of his life, the Buddha\u2019s compassion burned like a steady lamp, lighting the way for those who followed him. He embodied the very message he gave: boundless love, clarity of vision, and tireless effort.</p>\n<p>Having stayed at Ambala\u1e6d\u1e6dhik\u0101 as long as he wished, the Master turned to \u0100nanda and said:</p>\n<p><i>\"Let us go to N\u0101\u1e37and\u0101.\"</i></p>\n<p>And so they continued northward\u2014toward the next resting place on this final and sacred journey.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page19_2/image99.png\" />\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>Silao to Nalanda distance is about 8.7 km</b></p>\n<h2>N\u0101\u1e37and\u0101: The Ideal Second Stop</h2>\n<p>From the royal guesthouse at Ambala\u1e6d\u1e6dhik\u0101\u2014likely near present-day Silao\u2014the Blessed One continued his journey toward N\u0101\u1e37and\u0101, accompanied by a large community of bhikkhus. <span id=\"Endnote26\">[<a href=\"#endnote26\">26</a>]</span></p>\n<p>The distance was about 8.7 kilometres, or roughly 0.7 yojanas\u2014a notably shorter stretch compared to the Buddha\u2019s earlier travels, which often covered a full yojana per day.

This P\u0101v\u0101rika is distinct from the similarly named benefactor at Kosamb\u012b. The texts mention this grove several times as a resting place during the Buddha\u2019s travels to and from R\u0101jagaha (DN 11, DN 28, SN 47, SN 35), suggesting its role as a familiar and supportive sanctuary.</p>\n<p>Although the great N\u0101\u1e37and\u0101 Mah\u0101vih\u0101ra\u2014the renowned university\u2014was established in later centuries, N\u0101\u1e37and\u0101 was already a spiritually significant place in the Buddha\u2019s time.

But S\u0101riputta humbly explained:</p>\n<p>\u201cLord, while I do not know the minds of the Buddhas, I know the <i>drift</i> of the Dhamma. Just as a wise gatekeeper may not see every crack in the fortress wall, but knows that all who enter or leave the city must pass through the one main gate\u2014so too, all Arahant Buddhas attain enlightenment by abandoning the five hindrances, firmly establishing the four foundations of mindfulness, and realizing the seven factors of enlightenment. This, Lord, is the gate through which they all pass.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Buddha rejoiced in this reply, praising S\u0101riputta\u2019s insight:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cGood, good, S\u0101riputta! Therefore, you should frequently share this Dhamma exposition with the bhikkhus and bhikkhun\u012bs, with male and female lay followers.

Niga\u1e47\u1e6dha N\u0101taputta, too, was staying in N\u0101\u1e37and\u0101 at that time with a large assembly of his own followers. Having listened to the Dhamma of the Blessed One, Up\u0101li became established in faith, attained the state of a stream-enterer, and from then on became a devoted follower of the Buddha.</p>\n<p>When news of Up\u0101li\u2019s conversion reached Niga\u1e47\u1e6dha N\u0101taputta, he lamented, <i>\u201cYou have been caught by the great net of the doctrine of the recluse Gotama\u2026 you have been converted by the recluse Gotama through his converting magic.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>This remarkable story, though not mentioned in the <i>Mah\u0101parinibb\u0101na Sutta (DN:16)</i>, is traditionally accepted to have taken place during the Buddha\u2019s final journey. There are several reasons to support this view:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1)\t<b>Location and Timing</b></p>\n<p>The <i>Up\u0101li Sutta</i> clearly states that both the Buddha and Niga\u1e47\u1e6dha N\u0101taputta were residing in N\u0101\u1e37and\u0101 at the time. According to the <i>Mah\u0101parinibb\u0101na Sutta</i>, the Blessed One did pass through N\u0101\u1e37and\u0101 during his final journey toward Kusin\u0101r\u0101, spending time there at P\u0101v\u0101rika\u2019s Mango Grove.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2)\t<b>The Sudden Death of Niga\u1e47\u1e6dha N\u0101taputta</b></p>\n<p>At the conclusion of the <i>Up\u0101li Sutta</i>, it is said that Niga\u1e47\u1e6dha N\u0101taputta was overwhelmed with distress upon hearing Up\u0101li praise the Buddha. The commentary explains that due to intense grief at losing such a prominent lay supporter, he suffered a bodily disorder and vomited hot blood. He was then transported to P\u0101v\u0101, where he soon passed away. Tradition holds that few beings survive such a condition, marking this as a significant and final episode in Niga\u1e47\u1e6dha N\u0101taputta\u2019s life.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>3)\t<b>Confirmation in the </b><b><i>D\u012bgha Nik\u0101ya</i></b></p>\n<p>In <i>D\u012bgha Nik\u0101ya 29</i> (<i>P\u0101s\u0101dika Sutta</i>), it is recorded that the novice Cunda, who had spent the rains at P\u0101v\u0101, brought news of Niga\u1e47\u1e6dha N\u0101taputta\u2019s death to Venerable \u0100nanda at S\u0101m\u0101g\u0101ma. \u0100nanda then went with Cunda to inform the Buddha. While this sutta does not explicitly place the event during the Buddha\u2019s final journey, the Buddha\u2019s reflection in response strongly hints at his approaching final days:</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>But now, Cunda, I have appeared in the world as an Arahant, a Fully Enlightened One\u2026 But now I am an aged teacher of long standing, who went forth a long time ago, and my life is coming to its close</i>.\u201d (<i>DN 29</i>)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>4)\t<b>The Mysterious Village of S\u0101m\u0101g\u0101ma</b></p>\n<p>The location of S\u0101m\u0101g\u0101ma is not identified on modern maps, but other references provide clues. In <i>AN 6.21</i>, the Buddha is said to have stayed at \u201cS\u0101m\u0101g\u0101maka among the Sakyans, near the lotus pond.\u201d The commentary confirms that both suttas refer to the same S\u0101m\u0101g\u0101ma, suggesting that Sakyans inhabited this area within the Vajjian confederacy\u2014possibly near Ves\u0101l\u012b\u2014where the Buddha also stayed during his final journey.</p>\n<p>The presence of Sakyans in this region is further supported by the historical and geographical context. The Vajjian confederacy included the Licchavis of Ves\u0101l\u012b and the Vedehis of Videha (to which King Aj\u0101tasattu\u2019s mother belonged), with their capital at Mithil\u0101. The Videha republic covered parts of present-day Bihar and southeastern Nepal. This suggests that, during his journey northward to Kusin\u0101r\u0101, the Buddha may have deliberately visited areas inhabited by Sakyans for their benefit. (see the map below)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>5)\t<b>Further Supporting Traditions</b></p>\n<p>The <i>Apad\u0101na</i> commentary (ApA.i.106) offers a clue about the cultural interconnections of this region, mentioning that Venerable \u0100nanda was called \u201cVedehamu\u1e47i\u201d because his mother came from Videha, even though he was a Sakyan prince. This supports the idea of Sakyan-Videhan ties and helps explain the Buddha\u2019s movement through these regions during his final journey.</p>\n<p><b>Conclusion:</b></p>\n<p>While the <i>Mah\u0101parinibb\u0101na Sutta</i> does not specifically mention Up\u0101li\u2019s conversion, the timing, location, and related traditions strongly suggest that the <i>Up\u0101li Sutta</i> was indeed delivered during the Buddha\u2019s final journey. Therefore, we believe it is both meaningful and appropriate to include this interpretation in our publication\u2014as a reasoned proposal supported by scriptural cross-references and traditional commentary, offered with humility and respect for the Dhamma.</p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page19_2/image102.png\" />\n<p></p>\n<p><b>Map showing the Location of Videha</b><span id=\"Endnote31\">[<a href=\"#endnote31\">31</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>The Converting Magic of the Buddha</h3>\n<p>In the time of the Buddha, even the most confident opponents found themselves transformed by the power of truth. This is the story of Up\u0101li, a wealthy lay disciple of the Niga\u1e47\u1e6dhas, who set out to defeat the Buddha in debate\u2014but instead found the Dhamma.</p>\n<p>At that time, the Niga\u1e47\u1e6dha N\u0101taputta was seated with a large assembly of laymen from B\u0101laka, headed by the householder Up\u0101li. When the ascetic D\u012bgha Tapass\u012b was seen approaching in the distance, N\u0101taputta asked:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cWhere are you coming from in the middle of the day, Tapass\u012b?\u201d</i></p>\n<p><i>\u201cVenerable sir, I have just come from the presence of the recluse Gotama.\u201d</i></p>\n<p><i>\u201cDid you have a conversation with him?\u201d</i></p>\n<p><i>\u201cYes, venerable sir,\u201d</i> Tapass\u012b replied, and proceeded to relate his entire dialogue with the Blessed One.</p>\n<p>Upon hearing this, N\u0101taputta exclaimed, \u201cWell done, well done, Tapass\u012b! You have responded like a well-instructed disciple who rightly understands his teacher\u2019s doctrine. What is the trivial mental rod compared to the gross bodily rod? Indeed, it is the bodily rod that is most blameworthy in committing evil actions\u2014not so much the verbal or mental rods.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hearing this, the householder Up\u0101li agreed and declared:</p>\n<p>\u201cWell said, venerable sir, on the part of Tapass\u012b! I, too, shall now go and refute the recluse Gotama\u2019s doctrine on this very basis. If he upholds what Tapass\u012b made him uphold, then I will out-debate him\u2014just as a strong man might seize a long-haired ram by the hair and drag it to and fro. Just like a brewer\u2019s worker throws a sieve into a water tank and stirs it in all directions, I will handle the recluse Gotama in debate the same way.\u201d</p>\n<p>N\u0101taputta approved: \u201cGo, householder, and refute him. If not I, then Tapass\u012b or you must refute the recluse Gotama.\u201d</p>\n<p>But Tapass\u012b protested: \u201c<i>Venerable sir, I do not agree that Up\u0101li should go. For the recluse Gotama is a magician\u2014he knows the art of converting others.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>To this, N\u0101taputta proudly replied: \u201c<i>It is impossible that the householder Up\u0101li would become a disciple of Gotama. On the contrary, it is more likely that Gotama would become a disciple of Up\u0101li!\u201d</i></p>\n<h4><i>The Encounter</i></h4>\n<p>Thus, Up\u0101li departed to meet the Blessed One at P\u0101v\u0101rika\u2019s Mango Grove. After paying homage, he asked:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cVenerable sir, did D\u012bgha Tapass\u012b visit you?\u201d</i></p>\n<p><i>\u201cHe did, householder.\u201d</i></p>\n<p><i>\u201cAnd did you have a conversation with him?\u201d</i></p>\n<p><i>\u201cWe did, householder.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>Then the Blessed One recounted the entire dialogue with Tapass\u012b. Upon hearing it, Up\u0101li praised Tapass\u012b:</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Well said, venerable sir! Tapass\u012b answered like a faithful disciple. Truly, the bodily rod is the most reprehensible in performing evil, not the verbal or mental ones.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>\u201cHouseholder,\u201d said the Blessed One, \u201cif you wish to debate on the basis of truth, then let us proceed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI shall debate on the basis of truth, venerable sir.\u201d</p>\n<h3>The Paradox of the Mind-Bound Gods</h3>\n<p>\u201cSuppose a Niga\u1e47\u1e6dha is gravely ill. His vows forbid cold water, yet he longs for it mentally and uses only hot water. He dies without fulfilling his desire. Where would N\u0101taputta say he is reborn?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIn the realm of the 'mind-bound' gods, venerable sir. Because his mind remained attached.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHouseholder, pay attention to your answers. What you said now contradicts what you said earlier, and what you said earlier does not agree with what you say now. Yet you claimed, \u2018I will debate on the basis of truth.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>Despite this, Up\u0101li persisted: \u201cStill, I say the bodily rod is the most reprehensible.\u201d</p>\n<h3>The Hidden Destruction</h3>\n<p>\u201cWhat if a Niga\u1e47\u1e6dha is restrained in all four ways\u2014yet when he walks, he unintentionally kills many small beings. What does your teacher say about that?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf unintended, it is not greatly blameworthy.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut if it is intended?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen it is, venerable sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUnder which rod is volition placed?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUnder the mental rod, venerable sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHouseholder, again your words contradict themselves.\u201d</p>\n<p>Even so, Up\u0101li insisted: \u201cStill, the bodily rod is the most harmful.\u201d</p>\n<h3>The Similes of N\u0101\u1e37and\u0101</h3>\n<p>\u201cIs N\u0101\u1e37and\u0101 a thriving and populous town?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, venerable sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf a man with a sword said: \u2018In a single moment I will make all living beings in N\u0101\u1e37and\u0101 a mass of flesh,\u2019 would he succeed?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo, not even fifty men could do that!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut what if a recluse with supernormal power declared: \u2018With a single thought of hate, I shall reduce this city to ashes\u2019\u2014could he do it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, venerable sir, he could destroy many N\u0101\u1e37and\u0101s with one thought.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen, householder, which is more potent\u2014the bodily or the mental rod?\u201d</p>\n<p>Again, the contradiction in Up\u0101li\u2019s statements was pointed out. Yet he confessed:</p>\n<p>\u201cVenerable sir, I was already won over by your very first simile. But I wished to hear your varied solutions. Magnificent, venerable sir! You have made the Dhamma clear in many ways\u2014as if turning upright what had been overturned, revealing what was hidden, or holding up a lamp in the dark for those with eyes to see. I go for refuge to the Blessed One, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. Let the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower for life.\u201d</p>\n<h3>The Buddha\u2019s Gentle Encouragement</h3>\n<p>The Blessed One replied gently:</p>\n<p>\u201cInvestigate thoroughly, householder. It is fitting for well-known people such as yourself to examine thoroughly.\u201d</p>\n<p>Up\u0101li was even more pleased: \u201cVenerable sir, I am deeply moved that you did not seek to claim me, but encouraged me to examine the truth. Others would proclaim it proudly, but you, venerable sir, are truly free of conceit.\u201d</p>\n<p>And again, he declared: \u201cFor the second time, I go for refuge\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Then the Blessed One said, \u201cYour family has long supported the Niga\u1e47\u1e6dhas. When they come, you should still give alms.\u201d</p>\n<p>To which Up\u0101li replied: \u201cEven more do I rejoice, venerable sir. I had heard others claim you say: \u2018Gifts should only be given to me and my disciples.\u2019 But you have encouraged generosity to others. Still, we shall know when the time is right. So, for the third time, I go to the Blessed One for refuge\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>The episode of <b>Up\u0101li's conversion</b> beautifully showcases the <i>compassionate skilfulness</i> and <i>transformative wisdom</i> of the Blessed One. The Dhamma welcomes sincere inquiry. Transformation arises not by force, but through understanding. Even great opponents can become faithful followers. The mental volition is deeper than bodily action. The Buddha discouraged blind allegiance, even when someone converted. The Blessed One\u2019s wisdom lies not in conquering others\u2014but in illuminating the path to truth!</p>\n<h3>Praising the Blessed One</h3>\n<p>Grateful to the Teacher who gently guided him onto the noble path, and having abandoned wrong views to become firmly established in unwavering faith, the householder Up\u0101li extolled the Blessed One in verses filled with deep admiration and insight. He exclaimed:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cSuppose there were a great heap of many kinds of flowers, and then a clever garland-maker were to weave them into a multicoloured garland \u2014 so too, the Blessed One possesses many praiseworthy qualities, hundreds upon hundreds of them. Who would not praise the praiseworthy?\u201d</i><span id=\"Endnote32\">[<a href=\"#endnote32\">32</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>To uplift and inspire our readers, we have selected a few of these luminous verses:</p>\n<p><b>He is free from doubt and skilful,</b></p>\n<p><i>the discipliner and excellent leader.</i></p>\n<p><i>None can surpass his resplendent qualities;</i></p>\n<p><i>without hesitation, he is the illuminator;</i></p>\n<p><i>Having severed conceit, he is the hero:</i></p>\n<p><b>The Blessed One is he, and I am his disciple.</b></p>\n<p><b>The leader of the herd, he cannot be measured,</b></p>\n<p><i>his depths are unfathomed, he attained to the silence;</i></p>\n<p><i>Provider of safety, possessor of knowledge,</i></p>\n<p><i>he stands in the Dhamma, inwardly restrained;</i></p>\n<p><i>Having overcome all bondage, he is liberated:</i></p>\n<p><b>The Blessed One is he, and I am his disciple.</b></p>\n<p><b>The immaculate tusker, living in remoteness,</b></p>\n<p><i>with fetters all shattered, fully freed;</i></p>\n<p><i>Skilled in discussion, imbued with wisdom,</i></p>\n<p><i>his banner lowered; he no longer lusts;</i></p>\n<p><i>Having tamed himself, he no more proliferates:</i></p>\n<p><b>The Blessed One is he, and I am his disciple.</b></p>\n<p><b>The best of seers, with no deceptive schemes,</b></p>\n<p><i>gained the triple knowledge, attained to holiness;</i></p>\n<p><i>His heart cleansed, a master of discourse,</i></p>\n<p><i>he lives ever tranquil, the finder of knowledge;</i></p>\n<p><i>The first of all givers, he is ever capable:</i></p>\n<p><b>The Blessed One is he, and I am his disciple.</b></p>\n<p>With these radiant verses, echoing the heartfelt devotion of Up\u0101li, we conclude this section.</p>\n<p>The next part (19.3) will explore the profound and significant events that unfolded during the remainder of the Blessed One\u2019s final

Having stayed in N\u0101\u1e37and\u0101 as long as he wished, the Blessed One said to the Venerable \u0100nanda, \u201cLet us go to P\u0101\u1e6dalig\u0101ma.\u201d</p>\n<p>And so they departed together with the Sa\u1e45gha.<span id=\"Endnote1\">[<a href=\"#endnote1\">1</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Arrival at P\u0101\u1e6dalig\u0101ma (Present-day Patna, Bihar)</h2>\n<p>At the time of the Buddha, P\u0101\u1e6dalig\u0101ma was not yet a major city, but it served as a significant river port within the Kingdom of Magadha. In later centuries, it grew in importance and became known as P\u0101\u1e6daliputta, the capital of Emperor Asoka\u2019s great empire.

Eager to welcome the Buddha and the monks, they prepared a rest house \u2014 cleaning it thoroughly and arranging all that was needed.</p>\n<p>As evening approached, the villagers lit oil lamps, placed pots of water for foot-washing, and arranged suitable seats for the Blessed One and the Sa\u1e45gha. When everything was ready, they humbly invited the Buddha to enter and rest there. Out of compassion, the Blessed One accepted their invitation.</p>\n<p>Seated among the villagers, the Buddha addressed them with wisdom and care:</p>\n<p>\u201cHouseholders, there are these <b>five dangers for one who is immoral</b>, who fails in virtue.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1)\t<i>He suffers great loss of property through neglect of his affairs.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2)\t<i>He gains a bad reputation for immoral and improper conduct.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>3)\t<i>He becomes shy and fearful in any assembly \u2014 whether of Khattiyas, Brahmins, householders, or ascetics.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>4)\t<i>He dies in confusion.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>5)\t<i>After death, he is reborn in a woeful state, a bad destination, in suffering and hell.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>Then the Blessed One continued:</p>\n<p>\u201cHouseholders, there are these <b>five benefits for one who is virtuo</b>us, who succeeds in morality.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1)\t<i>By careful attention to his affairs, he gains great wealth.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2)\t<i>He earns a good reputation for moral and wholesome conduct.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>3)\t<i>He approaches any assembly \u2014 whether of Khattiyas, Brahmins, householders, or ascetics \u2014 with confidence and ease.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>4)\t<i>He dies unconfused, with peace of mind.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>5)\t<i>After death, he is reborn in a happy destination, a heavenly realm.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>The Blessed One then instructed, inspired, and gladdened the lay-followers of P\u0101\u1e6dalig\u0101ma with profound Dhamma teachings, continuing far into the night. When it was late, he said:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cHouseholders, the night is nearly over. Now it is time for you to do as you think fit.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>Filled with joy and gratitude, the villagers paid homage to the Blessed One and the noble Sa\u1e45gha.

Turning to the Venerable \u0100nanda, he asked:<span id=\"Endnote5\">[<a href=\"#endnote5\">5</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\u201c\u0100nanda, who is building a fortress here at P\u0101\u1e6dalig\u0101ma?\u201d</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u0100nanda replied,</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\u201cLord, it is Sunidha and Vassak\u0101ra, the Magadhan ministers.

They prepared a refined feast of both hard and soft foods, offered with heartfelt devotion. After the meal, the Blessed One expressed his gratitude through a radiant verse of <i>anumodan\u0101</i>\u2014rejoicing in their meritorious act:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\u201cIn whatever realm the wise make their home,</i></p>\n<p><i>Let them nourish those who live the holy life.</i></p>\n<p><i>The devas who witness such offerings will honour them in return,</i></p>\n<p><i>They will guard them as a mother guards her only child.</i></p>\n<p><i>And truly, the one whom the devas guard, lives in happiness.\u201d</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This was the last discourse given by the Blessed One in ancient P\u0101\u1e6dalig\u0101ma\u2014overflowing with compassion and guiding householders toward generosity, a virtue that brings happiness in this life and in lives yet to come.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Joyfully moved by the Buddha\u2019s words, Sunidha and Vassak\u0101ra paid homage. When the Blessed One rose and prepared to depart, the ministers followed him, saying:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\u201cWhichever gate the ascetic Gotama departs through today, let it be known as the Gotama Gate (Gotamudv\u0101ra). And whichever ford he uses to cross the sacred Ganges, let it be called the Gotama Ford (Gotamatittha).\u201d</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page19_3/image4.jpeg\" />\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3></h3>\n<p><b>Sabhyata Dwar in Patna- Gateway to the Ganges </b><span id=\"Endnote6\">[<a href=\"#endnote6\">6</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>A Note on P\u0101\u1e6dalig\u0101ma\u2019s Legacy</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>Today, P\u0101\u1e6dalig\u0101ma is known as Patna, the capital of Bihar. While the exact locations of the ancient Gotama Gate and Gotama Ford have not been identified, the spirit of that sacred encounter lives on. Near the banks of the Ganga, Patna now features the <i>Sabhyata Dwar</i>\u2014the Civilization Gate\u2014a grand sandstone arch that echoes the city\u2019s ancient glory. Though not directly linked to the Buddha\u2019s visit, its Mauryan-inspired architecture stands as a reminder of the deep spiritual and cultural roots of this region.<b> </b><span id=\"Endnote7\">[<a href=\"#endnote7\">7</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>The Buddha and the Sangha Cross the Mighty River Ganges</h2>\n<p>The River Ganges, as it journeys through the northern plains of India, is joined by numerous tributaries and streams, gradually widening until, near present-day Patna, it stretches over four kilometres (2.5 miles) across. In modern times, bridges such as the Gandhi Setu (Ganga Setu) span this mighty river, linking the southern city of Patna to the northern region of Haripur in Bihar. This impressive structure, 4.56 km long, <span id=\"Endnote8\">[<a href=\"#endnote8\">8</a>]</span> stands as one of the longest river bridges in India. But in the time of the Blessed One, there were no bridges\u2014only the flowing waters, ferries, and the compassion of boatmen.</p>\n<p>Throughout his long teaching mission, the Blessed One is said to have crossed the Ganges many times, each occasion filled with meaning and spiritual resonance.</p>\n<p><b>The first crossing,</b> though unrecorded, likely took place when the young ascetic was making his way southward to R\u0101jagaha. It is possible he passed through P\u0101talig\u0101ma, a village that would one day become P\u0101\u1e6daliputta. With no money and newly embarked on his path of renunciation, the ascetic might have relied on the kindness of a humble boatman who, moved by compassion, ferried him across the river without charge. At this stage, he had not yet cultivated the meditative mastery to traverse the river through supernormal means.</p>\n<p>The <b>second significant crossing came</b> soon after his enlightenment, as the Buddha journeyed with great compassion to the Deer Park at Isipatana to share the Dhamma with the five ascetics who had once supported him during his austere practices. Following the ancient route from Gaya to Varanasi, he approached the sacred city, which lies along the Ganges, a natural point of crossing. Tradition holds that a boatman refused to take him without payment, and since the Blessed One carried no possessions, the request could not be met. Yet he did not argue or demonstrate displeasure. Instead, he simply crossed the river through his supernormal power\u2014swiftly and serenely, not to impress or astonish, but as an expression of pure resolve and self-mastery. Witnessing this, the boatman was said to be so moved that he reported the event to the king, who then declared that all ascetics should henceforth be allowed to cross the river freely.  <span id=\"Endnote9\">[<a href=\"#endnote9\">9</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page19_3/image5.png\" />\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>The Buddha Crossing the Ganges River near Varanasi </b><span id=\"Endnote10\">[<a href=\"#endnote10\">10</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>In another instance</b>, recorded in section 14.3, we see how deep the reverence for the Buddha had grown. During a devastating epidemic in Ves\u0101l\u012b, the Buddha and the Sangha were invited by the Licchav\u012bs to bring solace to the city. King Bimbis\u0101ra, with great devotion, arranged for a royal barge to ferry them across the Ganges from P\u0101talig\u0101ma. He lovingly accompanied the Blessed One to the river\u2019s edge and waited in the barge until the Buddha and Sangha arrived. This episode reflects the honour and faith the people of the time placed in the Buddha, who had become a beacon of healing and wisdom in a suffering world.</p>\n<p>And yet, it is <b>the final crossing of the River Ganges</b>\u2014poignant and profound\u2014that remains etched in the heart of the Dhamma tradition. It took place during the Blessed One\u2019s last journey northward. By then, the rulers of Magadha, including King Aj\u0101tasattu and his ministers Sunidha and Vassak\u0101ra, resided at P\u0101talig\u0101ma. Yet no arrangements were made by them for the Blessed One\u2019s passage.</p>\n<p>Here is how the scriptures describe this moment:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cAnd then the Lord came to the River Ganges. And just then, the river was so full that a crow could drink from it. And some people were looking for a boat, and some were looking for a raft, and some were binding together a raft of reeds to get to the other side. But the Lord, as swiftly as a strong man might stretch out his flexed arm or flex it again, vanished from this side of the Ganges and reappeared with his order of monks on the other shore.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>Observing the people striving to cross\u2014gathering wood, weaving rafts, seeking boats\u2014the Buddha offered this verse on the spot:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cWhen they want to cross the sea, the lake or pond,</p>\n<p>People make a bridge or raft \u2014 the wise have crossed already.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>In these few lines, the Blessed One encapsulated the essence of liberation. While others seek means to cross, the truly wise have already reached the far shore\u2014free, serene, and unhindered.</p>\n<p>This final crossing of the Ganges was not merely a physical act; it was a symbol of the Buddha\u2019s journey beyond the world\u2019s tides. In silence, without fanfare, with only the Sangha by his side, he stepped across the river as if to remind us: the true path lies not in waiting for help, but in inner awakening.</p>\n<h2>A Brief Stop at Ukkacel\u0101</h2>\n<p>After crossing the Ganges River, the next logical stop on the Blessed One\u2019s final journey would have been Ukkacel\u0101\u2014the nearest crossing point on the northern bank of the river. As noted earlier (see Section 19-1):</p>\n<p><i>\u201cFrom Chapra, the Blessed One and his Sangha may have journeyed eastward along the serene northern bank of the Ganges River, covering approximately 57 kilometres (about 4.6 yojanas). Eventually, they reached Ukkacel\u0101, an ancient locality within the territory of Ves\u0101l\u012b, now identified with modern-day Hajipur in the state of Bihar.\u201d</i></p>\n<h3>Final passing (parinibb\u0101na) of two chief disciples, Venerable S\u0101riputta and Venerable Mah\u0101 Moggall\u0101na.</h3>\n<p>Although this stop is not explicitly mentioned in the <i>Mah\u0101parinibb\u0101na Sutta</i> (DN 16), we have chosen to include it here. Why? Because another important discourse\u2014the <i>Ukkacel\u0101 Sutta</i> (SN 47:14)\u2014records a deeply moving moment that occurred in this very location: the Blessed One\u2019s public acknowledgment of the final passing (parinibb\u0101na) of his two chief disciples, Venerable S\u0101riputta and Venerable Mah\u0101 Moggall\u0101na. We offer this episode not to dispute the canonical sequence, but in humility and faith, to fill a contemplative gap in the final journey narrative.</p>\n<p>As earlier noted, the Buddha undertook his last journey accompanied by many noble disciples. The <i>Mah\u0101parinibb\u0101na Sutta</i> mentions some of them by name\u2014such as Venerables S\u0101riputta (whose meeting with the Buddha is described in Section 19-2), \u0100nanda, Anuruddha, Cunda (the novice and younger brother of S\u0101riputta), and Upav\u0101na. The name of Mah\u0101 Moggall\u0101na is not mentioned in DN 16. However, based on the <i>Ukkacel\u0101 Sutta</i> (SN 47:14), we infer that he too was part of this final tour, as the discourse places the Buddha at Ukkacel\u0101 shortly after the parinibb\u0101na of both S\u0101riputta and Moggall\u0101na.</p>\n<p>According to the Ukkacel\u0101 Sutta: (SN47:14)</p>\n<p>\u201cOn one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Vajjians at Ukkacel\u0101 on the bank of the Ganges, together with a great Bhikkhu Sa\u1e45gha, not long after S\u0101riputta and Moggall\u0101na had attained final Nibb\u0101na. The Blessed One, surveying the silent Sa\u1e45gha, addressed the monks:</p>\n<p>\u2018<i>Bhikkhus, this assembly appears to me empty now that S\u0101riputta and Moggall\u0101na have attained final Nibb\u0101na. Earlier, this assembly was not empty for me. I had no concern for whatever quarter S\u0101riputta and Moggall\u0101na were dwelling in.\u2019</i></p>\n<p>He then declared with deep equanimity that even the most outstanding disciples are subject to impermanence. Their passing, he said, was like the breaking off of the largest branches from a great tree\u2014yet he felt no sorrow, for such is the nature of all conditioned things.</p>\n<p>The Blessed One then gave this enduring instruction:</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Therefore, bhikkhus, dwell with yourselves as your own island, with yourselves as your own refuge\u2014with no other refuge. Dwell with the Dhamma as your island, with the Dhamma as your refuge\u2014with no other refuge.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>This powerful teaching reminds us of the centrality of self-reliance and mindfulness of the Dhamma, especially during times of loss.</p>\n<h3>On the Chronology: A Note of Clarification</h3>\n<p>There is a small textual difficulty regarding the timeline of Venerable S\u0101riputta\u2019s passing. According to <i>Cunda Sutta</i> (SN 47:13), S\u0101riputta passed away in N\u0101lakag\u0101ma in Magadha. Novice Cunda then brought his bowl and robe to S\u0101vatth\u012b, where the Buddha was residing in Jeta\u2019s Grove. This seems to contradict the <i>Mah\u0101parinibb\u0101na Sutta</i>, which narrates the final journey from R\u0101jagaha to Kusin\u0101r\u0101, passing through Ves\u0101l\u012b but not returning to S\u0101vatth\u012b.</p>\n<h3>Bhikkhu Bodhi observes:</h3>\n<p>\u201cTo preserve the traditional chronology, the commentaries suggest that the Buddha made a side trip to S\u0101vatth\u012b following his rains retreat at Beluva (see DN II 98\u201399). S\u0101riputta accompanied him on this trip, and later took leave to return to his native village N\u0101lakag\u0101ma, where he passed away.\u201d (See: SN : Note:157)</p>\n<p>This explanation, while not found in the suttas themselves, offers a respectful harmonization of the available sources and is rooted in the faith that has preserved these accounts through generations.</p>\n<p>In recalling the stop at Ukkacel\u0101, we honour the lives and legacies of the two foremost disciples\u2014S\u0101riputta and Moggall\u0101na\u2014whose wisdom and spiritual strength upheld the Dhamma in their own time, and whose memory continues to inspire those who walk the Noble Path.<span id=\"Endnote11\">[<a href=\"#endnote11\">11</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page19_3/image6.jpeg\" />\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>The Buddha with his two chief disciples: Venerables S\u0101riputta and Moggall\u0101na </b><span id=\"Endnote12\">[<a href=\"#endnote12\">12</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A Meaningful Pause at Ko\u1e6dig\u0101ma:A village by the north bank of the Ganges</h2>\n<p>Continuing the Blessed One\u2019s final journey along the northern bank of the Ganges, we next arrive at Ko\u1e6dig\u0101ma, a quiet village steeped in spiritual significance. As recorded in the <i>Mah\u0101parinibb\u0101na Sutta</i> (DN 16), the Buddha said to Venerable \u0100nanda:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cLet us go to Ko\u1e6dig\u0101ma.\u201d</p>\n<p></i></p>\n<p>And thus, with a large Sa\u1e45gha of monks, the Blessed One proceeded to Ko\u1e6dig\u0101ma and stayed there.</p>\n<p>In <i>Section 19-2</i>, we examined several maps illustrating the final footsteps of the Buddha. Among them is a carefully researched map titled <i>Tath\u0101gatassa Pacchim\u0101 C\u0101rik\u0101 \u2014 The Realised One\u2019s Last Tour</i> by the respected Buddhist scholar Bhikkhu \u0100nandajoti. <span id=\"Endnote13\">[<a href=\"#endnote13\">13</a>]</span> In this map, Ko\u1e6dig\u0101ma is placed near present-day Hajipur, Bihar \u2014 situated on the north bank of the Ganges. Interestingly, this is also the region associated with Ukkacel\u0101, which we encountered just before. In modern maps of Bihar, ancient villages like Ukkacel\u0101 and Ko\u1e6dig\u0101ma may no longer appear, but tradition places Ko\u1e6dig\u0101ma on the ancient path leading toward Ves\u0101li (Vaishali), approximately 18 km away. (see the Google map given below).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page19_3/image7.png\" />\n<p></p>\n<h3>The Buddha\u2019s Profound Teaching at Ko\u1e6dig\u0101ma</h3>\n<p>While dwelling in Ko\u1e6dig\u0101ma, the Blessed One, ever-compassionate and mindful of his disciples\u2019 welfare, offered a profound teaching. He reminded the community of monks about the Four Noble Truths, which lie at the heart of liberation. With deep concern for the spiritual progress of the Sa\u1e45gha, the Buddha declared:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cMonks, it is through not understanding, not penetrating </i><b><i>the Four Noble Truths </i></b><i>that I\u2014as well as you\u2014have for a long time wandered on, caught in the cycle of birth and death.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>He went on to describe these Four Noble Truths once again:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\tThe Truth of Suffering</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\tThe Truth of the Origin of Suffering</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\tThe Truth of the Cessation of Suffering</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\tThe Truth of the Path leading to the Cessation of Suffering</p>\n<p>By fully understanding these truths, the Buddha said, the root of craving is severed, the fuel for rebirth is exhausted, and the round of sa\u1e41s\u0101ra comes to an end.</p>\n<p>The Blessed One then recited a verse, radiant with insight:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cNot seeing the Four Noble Truths as they are,</p>\n<p>Having long traversed the round from life to life,</p>\n<p>These being seen, becoming\u2019s supports pulled up,</p>\n<p>Sorrow\u2019s root cut off, rebirth is done</i>.\u201d<span id=\"Endnote14\">[<a href=\"#endnote14\">14</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>A Reminder: Morality, Samadhi, and Wisdom</h3>\n<p>At Ko\u1e6dig\u0101ma, the Buddha also emphasized the essential foundation of the path:</p>\n<p>S\u012bla (morality), Sam\u0101dhi , and Pa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101 (wisdom). These three serve as the pillars for abandoning unwholesome actions and cultivating wholesome ones\u2014by body, speech, and mind. Practised with mindfulness and wise attention (<i>yoniso manasik\u0101ra</i>), they lead to the development of liberating insight.</p>\n<p>With this, the Blessed One continued preparing his disciples for the time when he would no longer be with them<b> in person\u2014but where the Dhamma and Vinaya would remain as their guiding light.</b></p>\n<h2>N\u0101dik\u0101\u2014A Village of Realised Devotees</h2>\n<p>Resuming the northbound journey, the Blessed One, accompanied by the Sangha, departed from Ko\u1e6dig\u0101ma\u2014the serene village nestled along the banks of the sacred Ganges\u2014and made his way to the ancient village of N\u0101dik\u0101, situated on the road to Ves\u0101l\u012b. Though absent from the modern-day maps of Bihar, the N\u0101dik\u0101 of the scriptures was clearly a place embraced by nature and sanctified by spiritual presence.</p>\n<p>The texts tell us that the Buddha stayed there at the Brick House\u2014a rare structure in a village where most dwellings were made of wood. Its very name highlighted its distinctiveness and perhaps its symbolic strength, standing firm amidst a forested landscape.</p>\n<p><i>\u201cThe Lord went with a large company of monks to N\u0101dik\u0101, where he stayed at the Brick House; it says most buildings being of wood, this was exceptional, hence its name.\u201d</i><span id=\"Endnote15\">[<a href=\"#endnote15\">15</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But it was not only the natural surroundings that gave N\u0101dik\u0101 its noble character. According to the scriptures, it was home to many lay men and women who ardently and faithfully followed the Dhamma. Even those who had passed away were remembered for their deep realisation\u2014many having attained rebirths in celestial realms, and some, having broken free from the wheel of existence entirely, had realised arahantship.</p>\n<p>While the Blessed One was residing in this sacred village, the Venerable \u0100nanda approached him and humbly inquired about the destinies of those who had passed away. With boundless compassion, the Buddha listed the names of the departed villagers and declared their spiritual attainments\u2014ranging from stream-entry to full liberation. He then concluded with an astonishing revelation:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cWell over five hundred, by the destruction of three fetters, are Stream-Winners\u2014incapable of falling into states of woe, and certain of attaining Nibb\u0101na.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>Such a statement illumines N\u0101dik\u0101 as more than a village\u2014it was a sanctuary of profound realisation, a field of merit nurtured by the presence of the Tath\u0101gata.</p>\n<p>Yet, in his gentle and insightful manner, the Buddha used this moment to offer a deeper teaching to \u0100nanda. With characteristic grace, he reminded:</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>\u0100nanda, it is not remarkable that that which has come to be as a man should die. But that you should come to the Tath\u0101gata to ask the fate of each of those who have died, that is a weariness to him\u2026\u201d</i></p>\n<h3>Mirror of the Dhammma</h3>\n<p>Instead, the Blessed One offered the Mirror of the Dhamma\u2014a luminous method for self-realisation, where one need not inquire of others but reflect within and know with confidence the path one is on.</p>\n<p><i>\u201cTherefore, \u0100nanda, I will teach you a way of knowing Dhamma, called the Mirror of Dhamma, whereby the Ariyan disciple, if he so wishes, can discern of himself:</p>\n<p>\u2018I have destroyed hell, animal-rebirth, the realm of ghosts, all downfall, evil fates and sorry states. I am a Stream-Winner, incapable of falling into states of woe, certain of attaining Nibb\u0101na.\u2019\u201d</i></p>\n<p>And what is this Mirror of Dhamma?</p>\n<p>It is the possession of unwavering confidence\u2014in the Buddha, in the Dhamma, and in the Sangha. When such faith is deeply rooted, the disciple sees the path clearly and walks it with certainty, secure in the knowledge that liberation is assured.</p>\n<h2>Revisiting Ves\u0101l\u012b \u2013 The Glorious Capital of the Licchavis</h2>\n<p>The Mah\u0101parinibb\u0101na sutta tell us:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cAnd when the Blessed One had stayed at N\u0101dik\u0101 as long as he wished, he departed with a large company of monks and journeyed to Ves\u0101l\u012b, where he stayed in Ambap\u0101l\u012b\u2019s Mango Grove.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>With these words, we are transported to the ancient city of Ves\u0101l\u012b\u2014once the vibrant capital of the Licchavis, nestled in what is today Bihar, India. Ves\u0101l\u012b was not only a cradle of republican ideals\u2014home to one of the earliest known forms of democratic governance\u2014but also a city that shone in the light of the Dhamma. It was here that the Buddha delivered teachings of timeless relevance, leaving behind traces of his boundless compassion and insight. Earlier, the Buddha had praised the Vajjian people, encouraging them to uphold</p>\n<p><i>\u201c</i><b><i>The Seven Principles of Non-Decline</i></b><i>\u201d</i>, ensuring their prosperity and longevity. He declared:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cAs long as the Vajjians uphold these principles, they may be expected to prosper and not decline.\u201d</i> (DN 16 and Section 19-2)</p>\n<p>These principles emphasized unity, frequent assemblies, respect for tradition, protection of the vulnerable, and spiritual reverence\u2014guidelines for noble governance deeply rooted in moral discipline and collective harmony.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page19_3/image8.jpeg\" />\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>Modern day stupa in Vaisali </b><span id=\"Endnote16\">[<a href=\"#endnote16\">16</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page19_3/image9.jpeg\" />\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3></h3>\n<p><b>Ruins of Vaisali- the Ashokan Pillar, Stupa and Ramkund Tank</b><span id=\"Endnote17\">[<a href=\"#endnote17\">17</a>]</span><b></p>\n<p></b></p>\n<h3>The Sacred Sites of Ves\u0101l\u012b</h3>\n<p>The Buddha's visits to Ves\u0101l\u012b were marked by his stays at various significant places\u2014most notably the <i>K\u016b\u1e6d\u0101g\u0101ras\u0101l\u0101</i> or \"Peak-roofed Hall\" in the <i>Mah\u0101vana</i> (Great Wood).

The instruction was not merely technical; it was a compassionate forewarning. The next day, the Sangha would be welcomed into the home of a woman once famed for her charm and allure. The Buddha, with his infinite wisdom, anticipated the inner challenges some monks might face and offered this teaching as a shield\u2014a way to guard the mind through awareness.</p>\n<p>Indeed, in earlier instances too, we hear of monks swayed by worldly beauty, such as in the story of Sirim\u0101 (see section 16-2) The Buddha\u2019s teachings were thus not abstract ideals but a living, responsive guidance shaped with compassion and foresight for his disciples\u2019 welfare.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>To revisit Ves\u0101l\u012b is to return to a place of luminous history, where the winds still whisper tales of spiritual triumph and transformation. It is a city that welcomed the Buddha with joy, where courtesans became saints, and where the Dhamma took deep root among rulers and citizens alike. Let us contemplate its stories not as distant echoes of the past, but as living inspirations for our own path\u2014reminders that no matter one\u2019s station, beauty, or wealth, liberation lies within reach of a heart turned toward the truth.</p>\n<p>With that inspiring words we will end this section. The next section 19-4 will focus the Buddha spending his last rain retreat in a small village of Beluwa in Vajji country.</p>\n<h3>End Notes: Section 19-3</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<span id=\"endnote1\">[<a href=\"#Endnote1\">1</a>]</span>\t DN:16\n<p></p>\n<span id=\"endnote2\">[<a href=\"#Endnote2\">2</a>]</span>\t Source: https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/art-artists/work-of-art/part-of-the-city-of-patna-on-the-river-ganges\n<p></p>\n<span id=\"endnote3\">[<a href=\"#Endnote3\">3</a>]</span>\t Source: https://www.holidify.com/places/patna/river-ganga-sightseeing-3224.html\n<p></p>\n<span id=\"endnote4\">[<a href=\"#Endnote4\">4</a>]</span>\t Source: https://southeastasianlibrarygroup.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/or_5757_f023r1.jpg\n<p></p>\n<span id=\"endnote5\">[<a href=\"#Endnote5\">5</a>]</span>\t DN:16\n<p></p>\n<span id=\"endnote6\">[<a href=\"#Endnote6\">6</a>]</span>\t Source: https://www.justdial.com/Patna/Sabhyata-Dwar-Bankipur-Gandhi-Maidan/0612PX612-X612-220125233757-C1L8_BZDET\n<p></p>\n<span id=\"endnote7\">[<a href=\"#Endnote7\">7</a>]</span>\t Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabhyata_Dwar.\n<p></p>\n<span id=\"endnote8\">[<a href=\"#Endnote8\">8</a>]</span>\t Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridges_in_Bihar\n<p></p>\n<span id=\"endnote9\">[<a href=\"#Endnote9\">9</a>]</span>\t It says that this incident is recorded in  Lalitavistara S\u016btra. * The Lalitavistara S\u016btra is a Sanskrit Mahayana Buddhist sutra that tells the story of Gautama Buddha from the time of his descent from Tushita until his first sermon in the Deer Park at Sarnath near Varanasi, source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lalitavistara_S%C5%ABtra\n<p></p>\n<span id=\"endnote10\">[<a href=\"#Endnote10\">10</a>]</span>\t Source: https://www.superstock.com/asset/siddhartha-gautama-known-buddha-enlightened-one-he-crosses-ganges-river/4220-21848595\n<p></p>\n<span id=\"endnote11\">[<a href=\"#Endnote11\">11</a>]</span>\t The commentaries assign the death of Moggall\u0101na to a fortnight after that of S\u0101riputta.

Now, we explore his early years, from childhood to the transformative moment at the age of twenty-nine, when he left his royal life behind to embark on the path of an ascetic in search of liberation.</p>\n<h2>The Family of Prince Siddhartha</h2>\n<p>Prince Siddhartha\u2019s name, Siddhartha, means \u201c<b>he who achieves his goal,</b>\u201d <b> </b><span id=\"Endnote1\">[<a href=\"#endnote1\">1</a>]</span> and indeed, his life would unfold to achieve the supreme goal of enlightenment, bringing profound peace and wisdom to countless beings. Born in the city of Kapilavattu, Prince Siddhartha belonged to the Sakya Clan, a noble family of rulers. His father, King Suddhodana, and his mother, Queen Mahamaya, were revered for their wisdom and compassion. <span id=\"Endnote2\">[<a href=\"#endnote2\">2</a>]</span> However, the life of this noble prince was marked by profound sorrow, as his mother, Queen Mahamaya, passed away just seven days after his birth. <span id=\"Endnote3\">[<a href=\"#endnote3\">3</a>]</span></p>\n<p>In a gesture of love and compassion, Queen Prajapati, Queen Mahamaya\u2019s sister and King Suddhodana\u2019s second consort, stepped forward as the prince\u2019s foster mother. Queen Prajapati would later become a prominent figure in the Buddha\u2019s teachings, being the first to be ordained as a Bhikkhuni in the community of nuns, embodying the noble qualities of devotion and compassion.</p>\n<p>Prince Siddhartha also had a half-brother, Prince Nanda, and a half-sister, Princess Nand\u0101, children of King Suddhodana and Queen Prajapati, who were also part of the royal family that would witness the unfolding of his extraordinary destiny.</p>\n<p>The scriptures beautifully recount the significance of Prince Siddhartha\u2019s family. In the Mah\u0101pad\u0101na Sutta (DN:14), the Devas express the auspiciousness of the Buddha\u2019s birth and his noble lineage:</p>\n<p><i>\u201c\u2026In this fortunate aeon now, the Lord Buddha has arisen in the world\u2026 His father is King Suddhodana, his mother was Queen Maya, and his royal capital is Kapilavattu\u2026\u201d</i></p>\n<p>In the Udana, Venerable \u0100nanda Thera reflects on the profound nature of the Buddha\u2019s mother\u2019s passing: <span id=\"Endnote4\">[<a href=\"#endnote4\">4</a>]</span></p>\n<p><i>\u201c\u2026It\u2019s incredible, sir, it\u2019s amazing! How short-lived was the Blessed One\u2019s mother! For seven days after the Blessed One was born, his mother passed away and was reborn in the host of joyful gods (Tusita heaven)\u201d</i></p>\n<p>The Buddha, in his compassionate wisdom, explains:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cThat\u2019s so true, \u0100nanda! For the mothers of being\u2019s intent on awakening are short-lived. Seven days after the being\u2019s intent on awakening are born, their mothers pass away and are reborn in the host of joyful gods\u2026\u201d</i></p>\n<p>This passage illuminates the deep connection between the Buddha\u2019s life and the unfolding of his path to enlightenment, revealing the divine significance of his birth and the transcendent nature of his family. The early loss of his mother, though heartbreaking, set the stage for Siddhartha\u2019s eventual awakening and the subsequent teachings that would uplift all beings.</p>\n<p>The noble birth of Prince Siddhartha in the Sakyan family was not just a royal event; it was the beginning of a journey that would transcend worldly existence, ultimately bringing forth the wisdom that would guide countless beings to liberation. The compassion and the divine purpose behind his birth and his family\u2019s role in his life serve as a profound reminder of the interconnectedness of all beings and the deep compassion that the Buddha embodied, not only for his family but for the entire world.</p>\n<p><b>Ven. K\u0101lud\u0101yi Thera</b>, a devoted disciple of the Buddha, expressed the following: <span id=\"Endnote5\">[<a href=\"#endnote5\">5</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\u201c\u2026 </i><b><i>Suddhodana</i></b><i> is the name of the Great Seer\u2019s father, and </i><b><i>M\u0101y\u0101</i></b><i> is the name of the Buddha\u2019s mother, who, having nurtured the Bodhisatta in her womb, now rejoices in the threefold divine realm after the dissolution of her body. She, </i><b><i>Gotam\u012b</i></b><i>, having passed away, has transcended this world and is now blessed with heavenly sensual pleasures\u2026\u201d</i></p>\n<p>In the Dakkhi\u1e47\u0101vibhanga Sutta (MN:142), Venerable \u0100nanda also affirms that Queen Mah\u0101paj\u0101pat\u012b was the Buddha\u2019s foster mother. He states:</p>\n<p><i>\u201c\u2026 Mah\u0101paj\u0101pat\u012b Gotam\u012b has been of great assistance to the Blessed One, venerable sir.

She suckled the Blessed One after his own mother passed away\u2026\u201d</i></p>\n<p>Queen Praj\u0101pati, reflecting on her unique role as the Buddha\u2019s foster mother, said: <span id=\"Endnote6\">[<a href=\"#endnote6\">6</a>]</span></p>\n<p><i>\u201c\u2026 </i><b><i>Sublime One</i></b><i>, I am your foster mother, yet you nourished me with the milk of the </i><b><i>True Dhamma</i></b><i>.

However, even in his early years, two significant and unusual spiritual events occurred, foreshadowing the path he would one day follow, as documented in the scriptures.</p>\n<h3>Prophesy about Buddhahood</h3>\n<p>The first event took place when the renowned ascetic, Asita (also known as K\u0101ladevala), visited King Suddhodana to see the newborn prince. The ascetic, upon observing the child, prophesied that the baby would one day become a great spiritual leader: <span id=\"Endnote9\">[<a href=\"#endnote9\">9</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\u201c\u2026He is supreme, the best of men!

At just seven years old, Prince Siddhartha was found meditating under a Rose Apple tree. In this serene moment, it is said that he entered the first Jhana, a deep state of meditation. This early experience of profound samadhi and mindfulness would later lay the foundation for his spiritual journey to enlightenment.</p>\n<p>After attaining Buddhahood, the Blessed One recalled this moment from his childhood, describing it in the following way:</p>\n<p><i>\u201c\u2026I recall that when my father, the Sakyan, was occupied, I sat in the cool shade of a rose-apple tree, completely secluded from sensual pleasures and free from unwholesome states. In this peaceful solitude, I entered and abided in the first jh\u0101na, accompanied by applied and sustained thought, with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion\u2026\u201d</i><span id=\"Endnote12\">[<a href=\"#endnote12\">12</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This early meditation marked the beginning of Prince Siddhartha\u2019s connection with the path of inner peace, which would ultimately lead him to the realization of enlightenment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page2/image3.jpeg\" />\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>Prince Siddhartha\u2019s first meditation at the age of seven </b><span id=\"Endnote13\">[<a href=\"#endnote13\">13</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Young Prince Siddhartha </h2>\n<p>According to the scriptures, prince Siddhartha lived in the royal palace in<b> </b>Kapilavattu, the capital of the Sakyan Clan until the age of twenty-nine.

Their bond was one of unwavering faithfulness and spiritual dedication.

It is not easy, while living in a home, to lead the holy life utterly perfect and pure as a polished shell.</i></b><i> Suppose I shave off my hair and beard, put on the yellow robe, and go forth from the home life into homelessness\u2026\u2019</i> <span id=\"Endnote5\">[<a href=\"#endnote5\">5</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>At the age of twenty-nine, Prince Siddhartha renounced his life of luxury, leaving behind his royal lineage and all worldly comforts, in search of a path beyond the endless cycle of birth, aging, and death\u2014<i>sa\u1e43s\u0101ra</i>\u2014and the suffering it entails. His Great Renunciation stands as one of the most significant events in Buddhist history, a momentous milestone for the entire Buddhist world.</p>\n<p>The Buddha\u2019s noble departure set an unparalleled example of renouncing lay life for the path of liberation, inspiring generations of monks and nuns to follow in his footsteps. The world remains indebted to the Buddha Gotama, whose unwavering determination and boundless compassion illuminated the way to true freedom.</p>\n<h3>What Inspired Prince Siddhartha to Become an Ascetic?</h3>\n<p>The profound renunciation of Prince Siddhartha was not an impulsive act, but the culmination of deep insight and reflection. The suttas provide glimpses into what stirred his heart and led him to abandon his royal life in pursuit of the highest truth.</p>\n<h3>Witnessing the Suffering of Life\u2014Old Age, Sickness, and Death</h3>\n<p>The Buddha later recounted:<span id=\"Endnote6\">[<a href=\"#endnote6\">6</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cBhikkhus, I was delicately nurtured\u2014most delicately nurtured, extremely delicately nurtured... Yet, amid such splendour and luxury, it occurred to me:</p>\n<p>\u2018I too am subject to old age and am not exempt from it. If I were to feel repelled, humiliated, or disgusted when seeing another who is old, that would not be proper for me.\u2019</p>\n<p>When I reflected thus, my intoxication with youth was completely abandoned.</p>\n<p>\u2018I too am subject to illness and am not exempt from it. If I were to feel repelled, humiliated, or disgusted when seeing another who is ill, that would not be proper for me.\u2019</p>\n<p>When I reflected thus, my intoxication with health was completely abandoned.</p>\n<p>\u2018I too am subject to death and am not exempt from it. If I were to feel repelled, humiliated, or disgusted when seeing another who has died, that would not be proper for me.\u2019</p>\n<p>When I reflected thus, my intoxication with life was completely abandoned\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>These reflections awakened in him a profound understanding of suffering and impermanence. He saw with great clarity that all beings\u2014no matter their status, wealth, or power\u2014are bound by aging, illness, and death. The fleeting pleasures of the world could not offer lasting peace or freedom. With this realization, he set forth in search of a way beyond suffering, seeking the ultimate truth (<i>ki\u1e43kusal\u0101nues\u012b?</i>).</p>\n<h3>The Buddha\u2019s Own Words on Renunciation</h3>\n<p><i>\u201cWhile I was dwelling thus,</p>\n<p>Having known the state beyond all grasping,</p>\n<p>I overcame every intoxication\u2014</p>\n<p>Intoxication with health,</p>\n<p>Intoxication with youth,</p>\n<p>Intoxication with life\u2014</p>\n<p>Having seen security in renunciation.</i></p>\n<p><i>Zeal then arose in me, as I clearly saw Nibb\u0101na.</p>\n<p>Now I am incapable of indulging in sensual pleasures.</p>\n<p>Relying on the spiritual life, never will I turn back.\u201d</i><span id=\"Endnote7\">[<a href=\"#endnote7\">7</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Prince Siddhartha\u2019s renunciation was not a rejection of life, but an act of supreme compassion\u2014for himself and for all beings trapped in <i>sa\u1e43s\u0101ra</i>. His journey into homelessness was a path of courage, wisdom, and boundless resolve, leading to the great awakening that would illuminate the world.</p>\n<p>According to legend, Prince Siddhartha witnessed four significant omens\u2014an old man, a sick man, a dead body, and a recluse. Reflecting deeply upon them, he became determined to renounce his princely life in search of a higher truth <span id=\"Endnote8\">[<a href=\"#endnote8\">8</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Apart from a passage in the <i>Khuddaka Nik\u0101ya: Buddhava\u1e43sa</i> (quoted below), no other direct reference to these four events leading to Prince Siddhartha\u2019s renunciation can be found in the scriptures. However, traditional Buddhist narratives recount that he first encountered an old person, a sick person, and a dead body in a funeral procession. These sights deeply moved him, making him realize the impermanence of life\u2014that all beings inevitably age, fall ill, and die.</p>\n<p>The final omen, that of a serene ascetic, struck him profoundly. The sight of someone who had renounced worldly pleasures in pursuit of inner peace and liberation inspired him to abandon his own luxurious life and seek the path beyond suffering.</p>\n<p><i>\"I lived as a householder for thirty-one years... I saw the four omens and set forth in a horse-drawn chariot.

In traditional accounts, it is often portrayed as a sudden departure\u2014leaving his loved ones behind without consultation or conversation. However, the suttas provide a deeper perspective, revealing the immense wisdom and compassion that guided his decision.</p>\n<p>In the following sutta, the Buddha himself describes the thoughts that led him to renounce the world:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cWhy, being myself subject to birth, do I seek what is also subject to birth? Why, being myself subject to aging, sickness, death, sorrow, and defilement, do I seek what is also subject to aging, sickness, death, sorrow, and defilement?</i></p>\n<p><i>Suppose that, being myself subject to birth, having understood the danger in what is subject to birth, I seek the unborn, the supreme security from bondage... </i><b><i>Later, while still young\u2014a black-haired young man, endowed with the blessing of youth, in the prime of life\u2014though my mother and father wished otherwise and wept with tearful faces,</i></b><i> I shaved off my hair and beard, donned the yellow robe, and went forth from the home life into homelessness.\u201d</i> <span id=\"Endnote11\">[<a href=\"#endnote11\">11</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Though young and surrounded by royal luxuries, Prince Siddhartha saw the true nature of existence\u2014impermanence, suffering, and the endless cycle of birth and death. He realized that worldly pleasures were fleeting and incapable of providing lasting peace. This profound understanding shaped his path toward renunciation.</p>\n<h2>A Deeper Understanding of His Departure</h2>\n<p>It is possible that Prince Siddhartha discussed these truths with his beloved wife, Princess Yasodhar\u0101. In the <i>J\u0101taka Stories</i>\u2014which recount the Buddha\u2019s past lives\u2014they had been husband and wife across many lifetimes. In those past lives, whenever the Bodhisatta renounced the world, his wife supported and encouraged him. It is reasonable to believe that in his final life as Prince Siddhartha, she too understood the depth of his aspirations and the nobility of his quest.</p>\n<p>Traditional narratives often leave gaps in the story of his renunciation. Yet, when the Blessed One later returned to Kapilavattu, Princess Yasodhar\u0101 displayed remarkable wisdom and devotion. She pointed out the Buddha to their son, Prince R\u0101hula, and encouraged him to approach his father, saying:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cThat is your father, dear R\u0101hula. Go to him and ask for your inheritance.\u201d</i> <span id=\"Endnote12\">[<a href=\"#endnote12\">12</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>What inheritance could the Buddha offer his son? A <i>Samm\u0101sambuddha</i> possesses no material wealth, no kingdom, no treasures. The only gift he could bestow\u2014the greatest gift in the world\u2014was the path to liberation, the way to be free from <i>sa\u1e43s\u0101ric</i> suffering.</p>\n<p>Princess Yasodhar\u0101, a wise and loving mother, understood this truth. She did not cling to worldly attachments but instead guided her son toward the highest refuge.</p>\n<h2>The Compassion Behind His Departure</h2>\n<p>Would a being of such boundless wisdom and compassion leave without any parting words? It is unlikely. A prince destined to become the Buddha, who deeply loved his family, would not have abandoned them thoughtlessly.</p>\n<p>His renunciation was not an act of disregard but of profound love\u2014love that extended beyond a single lifetime, beyond personal relationships, toward the liberation of all beings. He set forth on this noble journey, not to turn away from his loved ones, but to find a way to end suffering for them and for the entire world.</p>\n<p>Thus, the Great Renunciation was not an escape, nor was it a selfish act\u2014it was the greatest sacrifice ever made for the welfare of all beings.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page3/image3.jpeg\" />\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>Prince Siddhartha leaves the Palace riding his horse amidst gathering of his family and friends </b><span id=\"Endnote13\">[<a href=\"#endnote13\">13</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page3/image4.jpeg\" />\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>Prince Siddhartha shaves his hair and becomes an ascetic</b><span id=\"Endnote14\">[<a href=\"#endnote14\">14</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page3/image5.jpeg\" />\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>Ascetic Siddhartha reflecting on his new freedom beside the river Anoma </b><span id=\"Endnote15\">[<a href=\"#endnote15\">15</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>The Wanderings of Ascetic Siddhartha</h2>\n<p>After renouncing lay life, Ascetic Siddhartha embarked on a profound journey in search of the <i>Truth</i>.

In the <i>Cank\u012b Sutta</i> (<i>MN 95</i>), he described the qualities of a good teacher, highlighting the importance of proper guidance on the spiritual path.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>At the same time, he also taught that if a seeker realizes that their teacher\u2019s guidance is insufficient for true liberation, they should move on.

He described the <b>fourth jh\u0101na</b>, a state of profound equanimity:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\u201cWith the abandoning of pleasure and pain\u2026I entered upon and abided in the fourth jh\u0101na\u2026 But such pleasant feeling that arose in me did not invade my mind and remain\u2026</i></p>\n<p><i>I thought: \u2018Why am I afraid of that pleasure that has nothing to do with sensual pleasures and unwholesome states?\u2019</i></p>\n<p><i>I realized: \u2018I am not afraid of that pleasure, since it has nothing to do with sensual pleasures and unwholesome states\u2019\u201d</i> <span id=\"Endnote43\">[<a href=\"#endnote43\">43</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This passage marks a shift in the Ascetic Siddhartha\u2019s understanding of pleasure. Unlike the fleeting pleasures of the senses, which lead to attachment and suffering, the joy of meditative absorption is born of seclusion and detachment. It is a necessary and beneficial aspect of the spiritual path, helping to stabilize the mind and deepen insight.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Rebuilding Strength for the Final Striving</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>Recognizing that his body needed strength for the deep meditative attainments required for awakening, the Bodhisatta decided to take food again:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201c<i>I ate some solid food\u2014some boiled rice and porridge. At that time, five ascetics were attending to me, thinking: \u2018If our recluse Gotama attains some higher state, he will inform us.\u2019 But when they saw me eating boiled rice and porridge, they were disgusted and abandoned me, saying: \u2018The recluse Gotama now lives in luxury.

Strengthening his body to endure the final striving, he prepared himself for the ultimate breakthrough. <span id=\"Endnote3\">[<a href=\"#endnote3\">3</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>However, his new mode of practice was misunderstood by the five ascetics who had been attending to him. Disillusioned, they left him and departed for the Deer Park at Isipatana. <span id=\"Endnote4\">[<a href=\"#endnote4\">4</a>]</span> Unshaken in his resolve, the Bodhisatta remained on the banks of the Nera\u00f1jan\u0101 River, dwelling in solitude, firm in his determination to attain the ultimate truth.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In the scriptures, we find a profound account of how he overcame the forces of M\u0101ra and realized what is called the <i>\u201csuperhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones\u201d</i> (<i>alam-ariya \u00f1\u0101\u1e47adassana visesa</i>). <span id=\"Endnote5\">[<a href=\"#endnote5\">5</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This was the final battle before enlightenment\u2014the triumph of wisdom over delusion, of truth over ignorance.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>The Five Great Dreams</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>Before his enlightenment, the Bodhisatta experienced five extraordinary dreams\u2014visions that foreshadowed his awakening and the immense impact his teachings would have on the world. In his own words:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\u201cBhikkhus, before my enlightenment, while I was still a Bodhisatta, not yet fully awakened, five great dreams appeared to me. What five?\u201d</i> <span id=\"Endnote6\">[<a href=\"#endnote6\">6</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1)\t<b>The Earth as His Bed </b></p>\n<p>He dreamt that the vast earth was his bed, the mighty Him\u0101laya his pillow, his left hand rested on the eastern ocean, his right on the western, and his feet on the southern sea. This signified his coming enlightenment\u2014an awakening that would shake the entire world and bring boundless benefit to all beings.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2)\t<b>The Grass Touching the Sky</b></p>\n<p>He saw a sacred grass (<i>tiriy\u0101</i>) growing from his navel, stretching up and touching the sky. This represented his realization of the Noble Eightfold Path and his role in proclaiming it to devas and humans alike.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>3)\t<b>White Worms with Black Heads</b></p>\n<p>He dreamt of white worms with black heads crawling from his feet up to his knees, covering them completely. This symbolized the vast number of lay disciples who would embrace his teachings and follow his path.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>4)\t<b>The Four Birds Turning White</b></p>\n<p>Four birds of different colours\u2014coming from the four directions\u2014fell at his feet and turned completely white. This signified that people from all social classes\u2014khattiyas (nobles), brahmins (priests), vessas (merchants), and suddas (labourers)\u2014would renounce the household life, enter the monastic path, and become his disciples.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>5)\t<b>Climbing a Mountain of Dung</b></p>\n<p>He saw himself ascending a massive mountain of dung, yet remaining completely unsoiled. This symbolized his future life as a renunciant, where he would receive the four requisites\u2014robes, alms food, shelter, and medicine\u2014without attachment, free from craving and clinging. <span id=\"Endnote7\">[<a href=\"#endnote7\">7</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>The Significance of These Dreams</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>Tradition holds that these five dreams were profound premonitions (<i>pubbanimitta</i>), revealing that the Bodhisatta was on the threshold of Buddhahood. They foretold his awakening and the vast, transformative reach of his teachings, which would shine across generations, guiding countless beings to the path of liberation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Encounters with M\u0101ra <span id=\"Endnote8\">[<a href=\"#endnote8\">8</a>]</span> </h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>On the occasion when the Ascetic Siddhartha was sitting in meditation under the <i>assattha</i> bodhi-tree <span id=\"Endnote9\">[<a href=\"#endnote9\">9</a>]</span>, in the bank of Nera\u00f1jan\u0101, river, M\u0101ra wanted to discourage him from attending liberation, wanted to hold him in his grip.

It is the dedicated resolve to:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\tAbandon unwholesome qualities that have already arisen,</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\tPrevent unwholesome qualities from arising,</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\tCultivate wholesome qualities that have not yet arisen, and</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\tStrengthen and develop wholesome qualities that already exist.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Right Effort is not merely a discipline\u2014it is a compassionate and guiding force, a helping hand that uplifts us toward the ultimate goal of liberation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>The Offering of Suj\u0101t\u0101\u2014A Moment of Significance</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>Tradition tells us that on the morning of his enlightenment, the Bodhisatta Siddhartha received a nourishing meal of milk rice from Suj\u0101t\u0101, the daughter of a householder in the village of Senani near Uruvel\u0101. <span id=\"Endnote12\">[<a href=\"#endnote12\">12</a>]</span> While the scriptures do not explicitly mention this event, the <i>Anguttara Nik\u0101ya</i> (AN 1:258) offers a striking reference to her:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b><i>\u201c\u2026the foremost of my female lay followers in being the first to go for refuge is Suj\u0101t\u0101, daughter of Sen\u0101n\u012b.\u201d</i></b></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This passage suggests that she played an unparalleled role in the Buddha\u2019s journey, offering a gift of sustenance that would empower him to take his final steps toward enlightenment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>The Sacred Act of Offering</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>The <i>Mah\u0101parinibb\u0101na Sutta</i> (DN:16) records the Blessed One\u2019s words about two uniquely meritorious acts of giving:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b><i>\u201c\u2026these two alms-giving\u2019s are of very great fruit, of very great result, more fruitful and advantageous than any other. Which two? The one is the alms-giving after eating which the Tath\u0101gata attains supreme enlightenment, the other that after which he attains the Nibb\u0101na-element without remainder at his final passing.\u201d</i></b></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>We know that the final alms-giving before the Buddha\u2019s passing was offered by Cunda. <span id=\"Endnote13\">[<a href=\"#endnote13\">13</a>]</span> But who, then, provided the meal before his enlightenment? Though the sutta remains silent on this, tradition leads us to consider Suj\u0101t\u0101 as the one who offered this auspicious gift.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Suj\u0101t\u0101\u2014The First Lay Woman to Take Refuge?</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>A deeper reflection on the Buddha\u2019s words raises an intriguing possibility: could Suj\u0101t\u0101 have been the very first laywoman to pay homage to the newly enlightened Buddha? In <i>Anguttara Nik\u0101ya</i> (AN 1: XIV), all other lay disciples described as foremost in different qualities are those who sought refuge in the Buddha after his enlightenment. Could Suj\u0101t\u0101\u2019s refuge have been an act of devotion preceding all others?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In contrast, the <i>Vinaya Pi\u1e6daka</i> <span id=\"Endnote14\">[<a href=\"#endnote14\">14</a>]</span> tells us that the first male lay disciples were the merchants Tapussa and Bhallika, who encountered the Buddha after his awakening. The Buddha acknowledged them as the first to take refuge, saying:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\u201cBhikkhus, the foremost of my male lay followers in being the first to go for refuge are the merchants Tapussa and Bhallika.\u201d</i> (AN 1:248)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Having received his alms, they bowed before the Blessed One and declared:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\u201cSir, we go for refuge to the Buddha and the Teaching. Please accept us as lay followers who have gone for refuge for life.\u201d</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>They thus became the first lay followers by way of the Double Refuge (<i>Buddha</i> and <i>Dhamma</i>).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This raises a compelling question: Was Suj\u0101t\u0101\u2019s offering a reverence to the ascetic Siddhartha before his enlightenment? Or was it a tribute to the newly awakened Buddha, the first act of homage by a laywoman? While the answer remains uncertain, her role in the sacred unfolding of the Buddha\u2019s enlightenment remains undeniably profound.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>Supreme Enlightenment \u2013 Samm\u0101sambodhi</h1>\n<p></p>\n<p>With unwavering determination and an unshakable resolve for liberation, the Bodhisatta strengthened his courage and deepened his effort.

According to the Mah\u0101pad\u0101na Sutta (DN:14), during the past ninety-one aeons, only seven Buddhas have arisen in the world. Buddhas appear at vast intervals of time, and during the long, immeasurable ages between their appearances, the world remains without a Buddha (abuddhassa).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In the absence of a Buddha, beings remain shrouded in the darkness of ignorance, unable to find the way to liberation. The world without a Buddha is a world without the light of wisdom\u2014a place difficult and uncertain for those seeking the path.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>Thus, the arising of a Samm\u0101sambuddha is not only rare but also the most extraordinary blessing for all beings.</b></p>\n<h2>The Supreme Teacher and Guide to Liberation</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>One of the most profound distinctions of a Samm\u0101sambuddha is that only a Fully Enlightened Buddha possesses the ability to teach the Dhamma\u2014to illuminate the path that leads both devas and humans toward liberation from the endless cycle of sa\u1e41s\u0101ric<b> </b>suffering.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>While the scriptures mention that from time-to-time Paccekabuddhas (Solitary Buddhas) arise\u2014these noble ones attain enlightenment through their own wisdom\u2014they do not teach the Dhamma, nor do they establish a dispensation (S\u0101sana) that flourishes<b> </b>beyond their lifetime. Only a Samm\u0101sambuddha has both the wisdom and the boundless compassion to proclaim the path to all beings, ensuring that the light of the Dhamma continues to shine, guiding generations long after his passing.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>The Supreme Healer of the World</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>A Samm\u0101sambuddha is like the supreme physician, tending to the ailments of the world. Through his immeasurable compassion and unsurpassed wisdom, he diagnoses the root causes of suffering and prescribes the cure\u2014the Noble Eightfold Path\u2014leading beings toward true peace and liberation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>According to the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta (the First Sermon), it is only a Samm\u0101sambuddha who has the power to set in motion the Wheel of the Dhamma\u2014a wheel that, once turned, cannot be stopped by any being in the universe. It continues to roll until the dispensation of the Buddha gradually fades from the earth.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A Rare and Precious Opportunity</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>This truth should encourage and uplift the followers of the Blessed One. Even now, in this 21st century, we are living in an era where the Dhamma proclaimed by the Buddha is still available to us. We are incredibly fortunate to have knowledge of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha\u2014to have the opportunity to take refuge in the Triple Gem and walk the path he so compassionately revealed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>This leaves us with a choice:</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\t\tWe can <b>follow his guidance as lay followers</b>, cultivating wholesome deeds and practicing the Dhamma to lead lives of peace and happiness, both in this existence and in those to come.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\t\tOr, if we possess <b>greater wisdom and courage</b>, we may choose the <b>monastic path</b>, dedicating ourselves fully to the spiritual life, and extending our support to others by spreading the <b>sublime Dhamma</b> that the Blessed One so tirelessly proclaimed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>How Can We Repay the Blessed One?</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>The greatest way to honor and repay the Blessed One is not through mere words of gratitude, but by walking the path he illuminated for us. Through his own boundless wisdom and supreme effort, he broke through the darkness of ignorance and revealed the way to true liberation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Later in this compilation, we will witness his untiring service to the world\u2014from the moment of his enlightenment at the age of thirty-five, until his final passing at eighty. For forty-five years, he wandered ceaselessly, sharing the Dhamma with all who had the ears to hear.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A Samm\u0101sambuddha is not just an enlightened being\u2014he is the knower of the entire world, the supreme guide who alone can lead suffering beings safely to the other shore.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>May we cherish this rare opportunity, and may we strive to walk in his footsteps!</b></p>\n<h1>Events Following the Enlightenment</h1>\n<p></p>\n<p>After the attainment of Nibb\u0101na, the newly enlightened Buddha encountered various trials that revealed the nature of the world. These events not only demonstrate the unshakable wisdom and purity of the Blessed One but also serve as reminders for those aspiring to walk the spiritual path. While a <b>S</b>amm\u0101sambuddha cannot be ensnared by worldly temptations, seekers of truth must remain ever-vigilant against the snares of M\u0101ra, which seek to pull them away from the path to liberation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>M\u0101ra\u2019s Challenge and Defeat</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>Soon after his enlightenment, as the Buddha sat immersed in the bliss of sam\u0101dhi at Uruvel\u0101, beneath the Goatherd\u2019s Banyan Tree, M\u0101ra\u2014the embodiment of delusion and death\u2014once again approached him. Still uncertain about the Bodhisatta\u2019s supreme liberation, M\u0101ra tried to challenge the Buddha\u2019s path, saying:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cHaving abandoned the austere practices</p>\n<p>By which men purify themselves,</p>\n<p>Being impure, you think you are pure;</p>\n<p>You have strayed from the path to purity.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But the Blessed One, with unwavering wisdom, replied:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cHaving seen that all austerities</p>\n<p>Aimed at the deathless state are futile,</p>\n<p>Like oars and rudder on dry land,</p>\n<p>I have walked the true path to enlightenment\u2014</p>\n<p>A path of virtue, samadhi, and wisdom.</p>\n<p>I have attained supreme purity:</p>\n<p>You are defeated, End-maker!\u201d <span id=\"Endnote36\">[<a href=\"#endnote36\">36</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Realizing that he had no power over the Buddha, M\u0101ra was vanquished.

Seeing their father in despair, his daughters\u2014Ta\u1e47h\u0101 (Craving), Arat\u012b (Discontent), and Rag\u0101 (Passion)\u2014approached him and asked what troubled him. M\u0101ra, still lamenting his loss, replied:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\u201cThe Arahant, the Fortunate One in the world,</p>\n<p>Has gone beyond M\u0101ra\u2019s realm:</p>\n<p>That is why I grieve so bitterly.\u201d </i><span id=\"Endnote38\">[<a href=\"#endnote38\">38</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Determined to succeed where their father had failed, the three daughters boasted of their charms, saying:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\u201c\u2026With our beauty and allure, we shall ensnare him.</p>\n<p>As hunters trap a mighty elephant in the forest,</p>\n<p>We shall bind him and bring him back under your control.\u201d</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>With confidence in their powers of seduction, the daughters of M\u0101ra approached the Blessed One and, in sweet and enticing voices, tried to lure him:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\u201cWe are at your service, ascetic\u2026</p>\n<p>We shall bring you joy, O sage\u2026\u201d</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Yet the Buddha, who had completely transcended lust, hatred, and delusion, remained utterly unmoved. The three maidens\u2014who could have captivated any other being in the world\u2014found that their charms had no effect.

Seeing this, Muchalinda, the N\u0101ga King, emerged and wrapped his mighty coils around the Buddha\u2019s body, shielding him with his hood to protect him from the heavy rains and winds.</p>\n<p>When the storm passed and the Buddha emerged from meditation, realizing the N\u0101ga King\u2019s act of kindness, he uttered the following <i>Ud\u0101na</i> (inspired exclamation), emphasizing the joy and peace that arise from a life of non-harming:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cSeclusion is bliss for the contented,</p>\n<p>Who sees the truth of the Dhamma.</p>\n<p>Kindness to the world is true happiness,</p>\n<p>For one who is harmless to all beings.</i></p>\n<p><i>Dispassion from the world is happiness,</p>\n<p>For one who has overcome sensual craving.</p>\n<p>But transcending the conceit \u2018I am\u2019\u2014</p>\n<p>This, indeed, is the highest bliss.\u201d </i><span id=\"Endnote58\">[<a href=\"#endnote58\">58</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This teaching closely aligns with the <b>Mett\u0101 Sutta</b>, where the Buddha declares that spreading boundless loving-kindness to all beings is an essential quality for those walking the Noble Path.</p>\n<p><b>Note</b>: Apart from being harmless, in here we can see some other essential qualities supporting the spirituality such as seclusion, loving kindness (metta) to all, dispassion towards worldly things and abandon of conceit.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page4/image6.jpeg\" />\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>Muchalinda Naga giving protection to the Buddha </b><span id=\"Endnote59\">[<a href=\"#endnote59\">59</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>Honouring the Dhamma</h1>\n<p>Not long after hi<i>s </i>Supreme Awakening, while dwelling at Uruvel\u0101, on the banks of the Nera\u00f1jar\u0101 River, beneath the Goatherd\u2019s Banyan Tree, a profound reflection arose in the Blessed One\u2019s mind: <span id=\"Endnote60\">[<a href=\"#endnote60\">60</a>]</span></p>\n<p><i>\u201cOne who lacks reverence and respect dwells in suffering.</p>\n<p>Now, which ascetic or brahmin could I honour, respect, and depend upon?\u201d</i></p>\n<p>As he contemplated, the Buddha realized:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cI do not see any ascetic or brahmin more accomplished than myself</p>\n<p>in knowledge and vision of liberation,</p>\n<p>whom I could honour, respect, and rely upon\u2026</i></p>\n<p><i>Let me then honour, respect, and dwell in dependence</p>\n<p>on the very Dhamma to which I have fully awakened.\u201d</i></p>\n<p><i>This profound resolution of the Blessed One reminds us that the highest refuge is not in any individual but in the </i><b><i>timeless truth of the Dhamma itself</i></b><i>\u2014the path of wisdom, virtue, and liberation.</i></p>\n<p>This shows the great wisdom and humility of the Buddha recognising the greatness of the Dhamma and sharing his experience with his disciples urging them to honour the Dhamma.

He reflected thus:</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>I have discovered this profound truth, so hard to see, so hard to comprehend.

He also displayed his highest wisdom by accepting a good advice.</p>\n<h1>Significant Events During This Time</h1>\n<h2>The First Step Toward the Establishment of the Fourfold Assembly</h2>\n<p>The Fourfold Assembly (<i>catuparis\u0101</i> in Pali) refers to the four groups who follow the Buddha\u2019s teaching: monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen. In the history of the Buddha\u2019s dispensation, we can see that the foundation of the Fourfold Sangha was laid during this period.</p>\n<p>At that time, two brothers, Tapussa and Bhallika, were traveling from Ukkal\u0101 to Uruvel\u0101, near the place of the Buddha\u2019s enlightenment. Following the advice of a deva, they offered food to the Buddha. After making the offering, they paid homage to him and requested to be accepted as his lay followers. <span id=\"Endnote69\">[<a href=\"#endnote69\">69</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In establishing the dispensation, the Blessed One, recognizing the importance of monastic disciples (both monks and nuns), also encouraged lay followers to become his disciples. This was not only for their own spiritual development but also to ensure the monastic community received the necessary support in the form of the four requisites essential for their survival.</p>\n<p>From the time of the Blessed One until the present day, the unwavering support of lay devotees has enabled the Buddha\u2019s dispensation to continue flourishing and illuminating the world.

We also witnessed how Brahma Sahampati honored the Buddha and earnestly requested him to teach the Dhamma. This event further illustrates one of the noble qualities of the Buddha: <b>\"Teacher of humans and devas.\"</b></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\t\tIt is mentioned that Buddhas do not receive food with their hands. When the Blessed One was contemplating how to accept the meal offered by Tapussa and Bhallika, the Four Great Kings presented him with four crystal bowls. According to tradition, through the Buddha\u2019s psychic potency, the four bowls merged into one. This became the first alms bowl that the Buddha carried after his awakening.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\t\tIt is also significant to note that devas recognized the <b>Samm\u0101sambuddha</b> as the supreme being of the world and played a role in supporting the growth of the dispensation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Summary</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\t\tIn this section, we saw how Ascetic Siddhartha, with his unwavering determination and wisdom, defeated M\u0101ra and his army, attaining supreme Buddhahood.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\t\tWe highlighted the noble qualities of a Fully Enlightened Buddha, emphasizing the importance of the appearance of an Awakened Being among those who lack knowledge of the true Dhamma.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\t\tWe briefly touched upon the period immediately following the Buddha\u2019s awakening and the profound Dhamma teachings he revealed to the world.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In the next section (4.1), we will explore how the Buddha established his Fourfold Assembly.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>End Notes: Section 4</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<span id=\"endnote1\">[<a href=\"#Endnote1\">1</a>]</span>\t The exact date of Buddha's enlightenment is not precisely known, as it predates written records. \u00a0It is believed to have occurred in the\u00a06th century BCE.

Sometimes the texts use the word \u201cM\u0101ra\u201d in a metaphorical sense, as representing the inward psychological causes of bondage such as craving and lust and the external things to which we become bound, particularly the five aggregates themselves. But it is evident that the thought world of the suttas does not conceive M\u0101ra only as a personification of humankind\u2019s moral frailty, but sees him as a real evil deity out to frustrate the efforts of those intent on winning the ultimate goal. The proof of this lies in his pursuit of the Buddha and the arahants after their enlightenment, which would not be credible if he were conceived of merely as a psychological projection. <b>See</b>: SN: Introduction to Sgathavagga, 4.

Now, we turn our attention to the profound moment when the Blessed One established the Fourfold Assembly\u2014bhikkhus (monks), bhikkhunis (nuns), up\u0101sakas (laymen), and up\u0101sik\u0101s (laywomen)\u2014the foundation upon which the Dhamma would take root and flourish for the welfare of countless beings.</p>\n<h2>Preparing to Teach the Dhamma</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>Having awakened to the ultimate truth, the Buddha, the Compassionate One, did not keep his realization to himself. Out of boundless loving-kindness, he resolved to gather disciples who would transcend worldly bondage and become bearers of the Dhamma, guiding others beyond the clutches of M\u0101ra.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Yet, M\u0101ra, the tempter, knowing that the Buddha\u2019s teachings would liberate beings from his grasp, sought to dissuade him from sharing the Dhamma. The scriptures recount this moment:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>M\u0101ra spoke: <span id=\"Endnote1\">[<a href=\"#endnote1\">1</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\u201cIf you have discovered the path, the secure way leading to the Deathless, then walk it alone. Why trouble yourself instructing others?\u201d</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But the Blessed One, unwavering in his resolve, replied:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\u201cThere are those seeking the far shore, longing to cross beyond the realm of Death. When they ask, I reveal the path\u2014free from all clinging and beyond M\u0101ra\u2019s reach.\u201d</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Thus, the Buddha set in motion the great wheel of the Dhamma, illuminating the path of liberation for all who sought to awaken.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The relinquishing of all acquisitions, <i>(</i><i>nir\u016bpadhi</i>) which are the bondage of M\u0101ra.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>The Fourfold Assembly</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Fourfold Assembly\u2014bhikkhus (monks), bhikkhunis (nuns), up\u0101sakas (laymen), and up\u0101sik\u0101s (laywomen)\u2014was established to uphold and transmit the Dhamma and Vinaya, the Buddha\u2019s teachings and discipline. The primary purpose of forming this assembly was to preserve the Buddha\u2019s teachings in their true essence, ensuring that both the Dhamma and Vinaya remained intact. Furthermore, it was to serve as a guiding force, spreading the Good Dhamma for the welfare and happiness of beings, not only in their present lives but also in future existences.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Buddha himself affirmed this vision shortly after his enlightenment, expressing his determination to establish a strong community of monks, nuns, and lay followers who would safeguard and propagate the Buddha S\u0101sana (Dispensation).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>The Buddha\u2019s Resolve to Establish the S\u0101sana</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>In the Mah\u0101parinibb\u0101na Sutta (DN:16), the Buddha recalls an encounter with M\u0101ra soon after his awakening at Uruvel\u0101, on the banks of the River Nera\u00f1jar\u0101, beneath the Goatherd\u2019s Banyan tree. M\u0101ra, realizing that the Blessed One\u2019s teachings would liberate countless beings, attempted to persuade him to enter final Nibb\u0101na without teaching others:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>M\u0101ra said:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cMay the Blessed One now attain final Nibb\u0101na. May the Well-Farer now attain final Nibb\u0101na. Now is the time for the Blessed One\u2019s final Nibb\u0101na.\u201d</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But the Buddha, steadfast in his great compassion, replied:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i> \u201cEvil One, I shall not take final Nibb\u0101na until I have disciples\u2014monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen\u2014who are accomplished, trained, and learned, who are bearers of the Dhamma, skilled in explaining it, and who will spread this path of wondrous benefit. I shall not take final Nibb\u0101na until this holy life is well established, flourishing, widely known, and proclaimed far and wide for the welfare of many.\u201d</i></p>\n<h3>The Buddha\u2019s First Missionaries</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Buddha\u2019s resolve to spread the Dhamma in all directions was further demonstrated when he addressed his first sixty disciples, instructing them to go forth and share the path of liberation:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Buddha said:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cBhikkhus, I am freed from all snares, both celestial and human. You too, bhikkhus, are freed from all snares. Therefore, wander forth, O bhikkhus, for the welfare and happiness of the many, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit and well-being of both devas and humans. Let no two of you travel the same way. Teach the Dhamma, which is excellent in the beginning, excellent in the middle, and excellent in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing. Proclaim the perfectly complete and purified holy life. There are beings with little dust in their eyes who are perishing because they have not heard the Dhamma. Some will understand upon hearing it.

Many suttas in the Sutta Pitaka describe the Buddha's noble qualities as well as his beautiful body. We have selected a few extracts from the scriptures where the physical bodily qualities of the Blessed One were described.</p>\n<h3>Discovery of Brahmin Student Uttara</h3>\n<p>According to the Brahm\u0101yu Sutta (MN:91) the Brahmin Brahm\u0101yu, sent his student Uttara to verify the report spread about the Buddha in his community as being true or not. He instructed his student to check all the noble qualities and also the so-called thirty-two physical marks attributed to the Buddha. Agreeing to fulfill his teachers wish, Uttara</p>\n<p>followed the Blessed One for seven months like a shadow, never leaving him. At the end of the seven months, he went to his teacher and reported:</p>\n<p><i>\u201c\u2026the report that has been spread about Master Gotama is true, sir, and not otherwise; and Master Gotama is one such as this and not otherwise. He possesses the thirty-two marks of a Great Man\u2026\u201d</i></p>\n<p><b>Note: </b>In his report to his teacher, Uttara described the thirty-two physical features of the Blessed One.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Confirmation of the Brahmin Sela </h3>\n<p>According to the Sela Sutta (MN:92), on one occasion the brahmin Sela, who was a great teacher of that time\u2014Master of the three Vedas\u2026fully versed in the marks of the Great Man\u2026, accompanied by three hundred students met the Blessed One seated in green grove with some of his bhikkhu disciples. He approached the Buddha, exchanged greetings and sat down nearby and looked for the thirty-two marks of a Great Man on the Blessed One\u2019s body, seeing all of them except two. The Blessed One, knowing that doubt occurred in the mind of Sela, performed a feat of supernormal power so the brahmin Sela saw the missing two marks. Then Sela said thus:</p>\n<p>\u201cO perfect in body, well favoured,</p>\n<p>Well fashioned and lovely to behold;</p>\n<p>O Blessed One, golden is your colour,</p>\n<p>And white your teeth; you are strong.</p>\n<p>The features are seen one and all</p>\n<p>That distinguish a man as well born;</p>\n<p>They are all to be found on your body,</p>\n<p>These marks that reveal a Great Man\u201d<span id=\"Endnote67\">[<a href=\"#endnote67\">67</a>]</span></p>\n<h3>The Brahmin Dona witnessing the Footprints of the Buddha</h3>\n<p>In the Dona Sutta (AN4: 36) describes how the brahamin Dona, who was travelling on the highway between Ukka\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101 and Setavya, saw the thousand-spoked wheels of the Blessed One\u2019s footprints, with their rims and hubs, complete in all respects, and thought: \u201c<i>It is astounding and amazing! These surely could not be the footprints of a human being!\u201d. </i></p>\n<p>Then Doana saw the Buddha sitting near the foot of a tree, went there and asked the Buddha whether he was deva or gandhabba or any superbeing. The Blessed One said that he is awaken being\u2014the Buddha.</p>\n<h3>How the Brahmin Student Ambatta\u2019s Doubt Disappeared</h3>\n<p>According to the Ambatta Sutta (DN:3), Ambatta the student of the brahmin Pokkharasati was walking with the Buddha and looked out for the thirty-two marks of a Gret Man on the Blessed One\u2019s body., seeing all of them except for two. He was in doubt and perplexity about these two marks. The Buddha, being aware of his doubts, enabled Ambattha to see those two marks on his body using his psychic powers.</p>\n<p>Then Ambattha went to see his teacher and reported thus:</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Sir, he (the Buddha) is as he is reported to be, and he is of such nature and not otherwise. He is possessed of the thirty-two marks of a Great Man, all complete, with none missing\u201d .</i></p>\n<h3>The Brahmin B\u0101vari\u2019s Descriptions of how to Recognise the Buddha</h3>\n<p>On one occasion the brahmin B\u0101vari, asked his students to go and see the Buddha and ask a question about \u201cwhat is head splitting?\u201d. But first the students wanted to know how to recognize the Buddha, and B\u0101vari said thus:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cThe marks of a Great Man have been handed down in our hymns. Thirty-two have been described, complete and in order. One upon whose body is found these marks of a Great Man has two possible destinies, there is no third.

So\u1e47ada\u1e47\u1e0da, a well-known brahmin of that city, planned to visit the Blessed One. Then his followers heard the news and said it was not fitting for him to go and see Master Gotama, instead Master Gotama should visit him. They gave the following reasons:</p>\n<p><i>\u201c\u2026the Reverend Sonadanda is handsome, good-looking, pleasing, of the most beautiful</i></p>\n<p><i>complexion, in form and countenance like Brahm\u0101, of no mean appearance\u2026</i><i> </i><i>He is aged, grown old, venerable, advanced in years, long past his youth, whereas the ascetic Gotama is youthful and newly gone forth as a wanderer. The Reverend Sonadanda is esteemed, made much of, honoured, revered, worshipped by King Seniya Bimbisara \u2026etc.  This being so, it is not proper that he should visit the ascetic Gotama, but rather the ascetic Gotama should visit him\u2026\u201d</i><span id=\"Endnote70\">[<a href=\"#endnote70\">70</a>]</span><i>.</i></p>\n<p>Then the Brahmin So\u1e47ada\u1e47\u1e0da said thus:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cThis good report has been spread about him: \u201cThis Blessed Lord is an Arahant, a fully-enlightened Buddha, perfected in knowledge and conduct...He bears the thirty-two marks of a Great Man\u2026</i><i> </i><i>Indeed, King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha has gone for refuge to him\u2026 Having come to Gaggara\u2019s lotus-pond, the ascetic Gotama is such a guest, and should be treated as such. Therefore, it is not proper that he should come to us, but rather we should go to him\u201d.</i></p>\n<h3>King Bimbisara Has Seen the Great Marks of Ascetic Siddhartha</h3>\n<p>When the Buddha was just an ascetic wandering in Magadha (see, Section Three), King Bimbisara saw him. This is what the scriptures says:</p>\n<p><i>The Buddha went to R\u0101jagaha,</i></p>\n<p><i>the Mountainfold of the Magadhans.</i></p>\n<p><i>He betook himself for alms, </i></p>\n<p><i>replete with excellent marks.</i></p>\n<p><i>Bimbis\u0101ra saw him</i></p>\n<p><i>while standing atop his longhouse.</i></p>\n<p><i>Noticing that he was endowed with marks,</i></p>\n<p><i>he said the following:</i></p>\n<p><i>\u2018Pay heed, sirs, to this one,</i></p>\n<p><i>handsome, majestic, radiant\u2026\u201d</i><span id=\"Endnote71\">[<a href=\"#endnote71\">71</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>Note:</b></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It is a fact that there are different opinions and attitudes in the present day regarding the thirty-two great characteristics of the Buddha, which he possessed as signs of a great man. In the following we can see that due to the good kamma he performed in his previous lives, the thirty-two signs of a great man were appeared in his body.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Buddha said thus:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cThese, monks, are the thirty-two marks peculiar to a Great Man, and for that Great Man who possesses them only two courses are open...and sages of other communions know these thirty-two marks, </i><b><i>but they do not know the karmic reasons for the gaining of them</i></b><i>\u201d</i><span id=\"Endnote72\">[<a href=\"#endnote72\">72</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The following notes have been prepared based on the information given in the scriptures with regard to some of the features of the body of the Buddha mentioned in DN:30 (Lakkhana Sutta)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2> Why the skin colour of the Buddha is like gold?</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>According to Lakkha\u1e47a Sutta (DN:30) the Buddha\u2019s complexion is bright, the colour of gold.

As he declared in the following sutta, he is called the Buddha because he realized four essential aspects of the path and guided beings toward freedom:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cBhikkhus, it is because of not understanding and not penetrating noble virtuous behaviour, noble concentration, noble wisdom, and noble liberation that you and I have wandered through this long cycle of existence...

The following quotes from the scriptures reveal why the Buddha is called Tath\u0101gata.</p>\n<h2>Tath\u0101gata is Fully Awakened</h2>\n<p>The Buddha explained:</p>\n<p><i>\u201c\u2026Bhikkhus, in this world with its devas, M\u0101ra, Brahm\u0101, and humans\u2026 whatever is seen, heard, sensed, cognized, reached, sought after, examined by the mind\u2014all that the Tath\u0101gata has fully awakened to; therefore, he is called Tath\u0101gata. Whatever the Tath\u0101gata speaks, utters, or expounds in the interval between the night when he awakens to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment and the night when he attains final Nibb\u0101na, all that is just so and not otherwise. Therefore, as the Tath\u0101gata speaks, so he does; as he does, so he speaks. Since he does as he speaks and speaks as he does, therefore\u2026 in this world with its devas, the Tath\u0101gata is the vanquisher, the unvanquished, the universal seer, the wielder of mastery; therefore, he is called Tath\u0101gata.\u201d</i><i> </i><span id=\"Endnote14\">[<a href=\"#endnote14\">14</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>In these words, the Buddha emphasizes his perfect realization, where nothing in the world escapes his awakened understanding, and his actions are in perfect harmony with his words.</b></p>\n<h2>Tath\u0101gata is the Accomplished One</h2>\n<p>When the Five Ascetics <span id=\"Endnote15\">[<a href=\"#endnote15\">15</a>]</span> addressed the Buddha as \"friend,\" the Blessed One responded:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cDo not address the Tath\u0101gata by name and as a \u2018friend.\u2019 The Tath\u0101gata is the Accomplished One, the Fully Enlightened One.

He illuminated the path with the light of Dhamma, dispelling the darkness of delusion for countless beings. Through his profound wisdom and skillful means, he transformed the minds of those trapped in wrong views, revealing to them the ultimate reality.</p>\n<p>The scriptures illustrate how the Blessed One, the greatest of all teachers, guided multitudes\u2014kings and paupers, ascetics and householders, scholars and sceptics, humans and devas\u2014toward the supreme truth. His words were not mere philosophy but a living path to liberation, accessible to those willing to listen, reflect, and practice.</p>\n<h3>As the 14th Dalai Lama eloquently advises:</h3>\n<p><i>\u201cIf you study the Buddha\u2019s teachings, you may find that some of them are in harmony with your views on societal values, science, and consumerism\u2014and some of them are not. That is fine. Continue to investigate and reflect on what you discover. In this way, whatever conclusion you reach will be based on reason, not simply on tradition, peer pressure, or blind faith\u2026\u201d</i><span id=\"Endnote2\">[<a href=\"#endnote2\">2</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Bhikkhu Bodhi, a renowned Buddhist scholar, further emphasizes the Buddha\u2019s universal role as a teacher:</p>\n<p><i>\u201c\u2026In the Majjhima Nik\u0101ya, we do not meet the Buddha only as the head of the Order. Repeatedly, we see him engaged in living dialogue with people from all walks of life\u2014with kings and princes, with brahmins and ascetics, with simple villagers and erudite philosophers, with earnest seekers and vain disputants. It is perhaps in this scripture above all others that the Buddha emerges in the role ascribed to him in the canonical verse of homage as \u2018</i><b><i>the incomparable leader of persons to be tamed</i></b><i>, the teacher of gods and humans.\u201d</i> <span id=\"Endnote3\">[<a href=\"#endnote3\">3</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>What made the Buddha\u2019s teachings so extraordinary was not only their profound depth but also the way he delivered them\u2014with immense compassion, perfect humility, and astonishing clarity. He did not seek followers; rather, he guided beings to discover the truth for themselves. Even those who belonged to other religious sects\u2014though they may not have followed his path\u2014respected him and paid him tribute, recognizing the greatness of his wisdom.</p>\n<h3>His teachings were not bound by tradition but pointed directly to liberation:</h3>\n<p><i>\u201cThe Blessed One taught the spiritual life,</i></p>\n<p><i>not based on tradition, culminating in Nibb\u0101na,</i></p>\n<p><i>lived for the sake of</i></p>\n<p><i>restraint and abandoning.</i></p>\n<p><i>This is the path of the great beings,</i></p>\n<p><i>the path followed by the great seers.</i></p>\n<p><i>Those who practice it</i></p>\n<p><i>as taught by the Buddha,</i></p>\n<p><i>acting upon the Teacher\u2019s guidance,</i></p>\n<p><i>will make an end of suffering\u201d</i><span id=\"Endnote4\">[<a href=\"#endnote4\">4</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>To truly grasp the greatness of the Buddha as a teacher, we turn to a few remarkable episodes from his teaching career, which reveal his skill, patience, and compassion in guiding beings to the highest truth.</p>\n<h1>The Buddha\u2014The Supreme Teacher of Wisdom and Compassion</h1>\n<p>The Blessed One once declared:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cBhikkhus, this spiritual life is not lived for the sake of deceiving people and cajoling them, nor for the benefit of gain, honour, and praise, nor for winning debates, nor with the thought: \u2018Let the people know me thus.\u2019 But rather, this spiritual life is lived for the sake of restraint, abandoning, dispassion, and cessation.\u201d</i><span id=\"Endnote5\">[<a href=\"#endnote5\">5</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Buddha\u2019s role as a teacher was unparalleled\u2014his wisdom penetrated the depths of reality, his compassion embraced all beings, and his ability to transform minds was truly extraordinary. Through perfect skill and profound reasoning, he led people away from ignorance and towards the ultimate liberation of Nibb\u0101na. The following accounts illustrate his supreme mastery in guiding beings from delusion to truth, from suffering to freedom.</p>\n<h2>The Buddha and the Brahmin Sundarika Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja</h2>\n<p>On one occasion, the Blessed One explained to a great assembly of monks and laypeople</p>\n<p>how the mind could be pure or impure, using the simile of a cloth. He taught that a mind</p>\n<p>purified by wisdom leads to true liberation. Sitting in that assembly was the Brahmin Sundarika Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja, who believed in ritual purification through sacred river bathing. When he heard the Buddha speak of \u2018inner bathing,\u2019 he became intrigued and asked:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cMaster Gotama, do you go to the B\u0101huk\u0101 River to bathe?\u201d</i> <span id=\"Endnote6\">[<a href=\"#endnote6\">6</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Buddha inquired why he considered bathing in the river necessary, and Sundarika Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja replied:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cMaster Gotama, many believe that the B\u0101huk\u0101 River grants liberation, bestows merit, and washes away evil deeds.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>The Blessed One then spoke these timeless verses:</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>B\u0101huk\u0101 and Adhikakk\u0101, Gay\u0101\u2026</p>\n<p>and the stream Bahumat\u012b,</p>\n<p>A fool may there forever bathe,</p>\n<p>Yet will not purify dark deeds.</i></p>\n<p><i>One pure in heart has evermore,</p>\n<p>\u2026one fair in act, one pure in heart,</p>\n<p>Brings his virtue to perfection.</i></p>\n<p><i>It is here, Brahmin, that you should bathe,</p>\n<p>To make yourself a refuge for all beings.</i></p>\n<p><i>With faith and free from avarice,</p>\n<p>What need for you to go to Gay\u0101?</p>\n<p>For any well will be your Gay\u0101.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>Hearing these sublime words, Sundarika Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja was overcome with reverence. He realized that true purification comes not from external rituals, but from purifying the heart through wisdom and virtue. With great joy, he exclaimed:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cMagnificent, Master Gotama! You have made the Dhamma clear, as one who turns upright what was overturned, reveals what was hidden, shows the way to the lost, or holds a lamp in the dark for those with sight to see. I go to Master Gotama for refuge!\u201d</i></p>\n<p>Through his understanding of the Dhamma, Sundarika Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja later attained Arahantship, achieving final liberation.</p>\n<h2>The Buddha and the Wanderer M\u0101gandiya</h2>\n<p>In the <i>M\u0101gandiya Sutta</i> (MN:75), we encounter the wanderer M\u0101gandiya, a hedonist philosopher who opposed the Buddha\u2019s teachings. He was so disgusted by the Buddha\u2019s renunciation of sensual pleasures that he mocked him, saying to his friend:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cThe recluse Gotama is a destroyer of growth. That is what we have learned from our discourse.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>However, the Blessed One, in his infinite wisdom, allowed M\u0101gandiya to express his views fully before responding with profound reasoning and a powerful simile. He said:</p>\n<p>\u201cM\u0101gandiya, suppose there was a man born blind who could not see\u2026He might hear someone say: \u2018<i>Good indeed is a white cloth, beautiful, spotless, and clean</i>!\u2019</p>\n<p>And so he would seek a white cloth. Then, a dishonest man would deceive him with a dirty, soiled rag\u2026 And the blind man, believing it to be pure, would wear it with satisfaction, exclaiming:</p>\n<p>\u2018<i>Good indeed is this white cloth, beautiful, spotless, and clean!</i>\u2019</p>\n<p>What do you think, M\u0101gandiya? When that blind man accepted the soiled rag, believing it to be pure, did he do so out of knowledge and vision, or out of faith in another?\u201d</p>\n<p>M\u0101gandiya answered:</p>\n<p>\u201cVenerable sir, he would have done so blindly, out of faith in another.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Buddha then declared:</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026So too, M\u0101gandiya, the wanderers of other sects are blind and visionless. They do not know health, they do not see Nibb\u0101na, yet they recite: \u2018<i>The greatest of all gains is health; Nibb\u0101na is the greatest bliss.\u2019\u201d</i></p>\n<p>Hearing this discourse, M\u0101gandiya\u2019s mind opened to the truth. With great sincerity, he declared:</p>\n<p>\u201cI have confidence in Master Gotama. Master Gotama is capable of teaching me the Dhamma in such a way that I may come to know true health and see Nibb\u0101na.\u201d</p>\n<p>Under the Buddha\u2019s guidance, M\u0101gandiya eventually became an enlightened disciple.</p>\n<h2>The Buddha and Prince Abhaya <span id=\"Endnote7\">[<a href=\"#endnote7\">7</a>]</span></h2>\n<p>One day, Prince Abhaya\u2014one of King Bimbis\u0101ra\u2019s sons\u2014was sent by his teacher, Niga\u1e47\u1e6dha N\u0101taputta, <span id=\"Endnote8\">[<a href=\"#endnote8\">8</a>]</span> to refute the Buddha\u2019s doctrine. He was instructed to ask whether the Buddha ever spoke words that were disagreeable to others. If the Buddha said yes, he could be accused of harsh speech. If he said no, he could be accused of contradicting himself.</p>\n<p>Prince Abhaya invited the Blessed One for a meal and then posed the question:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cVenerable sir, does a Tath\u0101gata ever speak words that are unwelcome and disagreeable to others?\u201d</i></p>\n<p>The Buddha, knowing his intent, replied:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cPrince, there is no one-sided answer to that question.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>Prince Abhaya was surprised and recounted his teacher\u2019s claim that the Buddha would be unable to answer such a question. <span id=\"Endnote9\">[<a href=\"#endnote9\">9</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Blessed One then gave a profound simile:</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Prince, suppose your young child were to put a pebble in his mouth. What would you do?\u201d</i></p>\n<p>Prince Abhaya replied:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cVenerable sir, I would remove it immediately. If I could not take it out easily, I would even use my hand to remove it forcefully, even if it caused some bleeding. Why? Because I have compassion for the child.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>The Buddha explained:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cIn the same way, a Tath\u0101gata speaks only words that are true and beneficial. If such words are agreeable to others, he knows the right time to speak them. If they are disagreeable, he still knows the right time to speak them\u2014but only out of compassion.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>Prince Abhaya, deeply moved by this teaching, asked another question:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cVenerable sir, when learned nobles and recluses ask you questions, do you prepare your answers in advance, or do they occur to you on the spot?\u201d</i></p>\n<p>The Buddha, knowing that Prince Abhaya was skilled in chariot-making, asked:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cPrince, when people ask you about chariots, do you prepare your answers beforehand, or do you know them instantly?\u201d</i></p>\n<p>The prince replied:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cVenerable sir, I know them instantly.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>The Buddha then said:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cSo too, prince, when people ask the Tath\u0101gata questions, the answer occurs to him on the spot, for he has fully penetrated the nature of all things.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>On that day, Prince Abhaya became an ardent disciple of the Blessed One and later attained Arahantship.</p>\n<p>The Buddha\u2019s skill in teaching was unmatched. With wisdom, compassion, and masterful similes, he transformed the hearts and minds of those who sought the truth. Truly, he was the supreme teacher of gods and humans.</p>\n<h2>The Buddha and the Wanderer Vacchagotta</h2>\n<p>During the time of the Buddha, views on the origin of the world, the existence of a soul, and what happened after death were hotly debated. The scriptures mention ten of these speculative views. <span id=\"Endnote10\">[<a href=\"#endnote10\">10</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>One time, the wanderer Vacchagotta approached the Blessed One and asked:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cMaster Gotama, do you hold any speculative view at all?\u201d</i></p>\n<p>The Buddha replied:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cVaccha, \u2018speculative view\u2019 is something that the Tath\u0101gata has put away. For the Tath\u0101gata has seen this: \u2018Such is material form, such is its origin, such is its disappearance; such is feeling, such is its origin, such is its disappearance; such is perception, such is its origin, such is its disappearance; such are formations, such is their origin, such is their disappearance; such is consciousness, such is its origin, such is its disappearance.\u2019 Therefore, I say, with the destruction, fading away, cessation, giving up, and relinquishing of all conceiving, all excogitations, all I-making, mine-making, and the underlying tendency to conceit, the Tath\u0101gata is liberated through not clinging.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>Then Vaccha asked:</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen a bhikkhu\u2019s mind is liberated in this way, Master Gotama, where does he reappear after death?\u201d</p>\n<p>The dialogue between the Blessed One and Vaccha unfolded as follows:</p>\n<p>Buddha: \u201cThe term \u2018reappears\u2019 does not apply, Vaccha.\u201d</p>\n<p>Vaccha: \u201cThen he does not reappear, Master Gotama?\u201d</p>\n<p>Buddha: \u201cThe term \u2018does not reappear\u2019 does not apply, Vaccha.\u201d</p>\n<p>Vaccha: \u201cThen he both reappears and does not reappear, Master Gotama?\u201d</p>\n<p>Buddha: \u201cThe term \u2018both reappears and does not reappear\u2019 does not apply, Vaccha.\u201d</p>\n<p>Vaccha: \u201cThen he neither reappears nor does not reappear, Master Gotama?\u201d</p>\n<p>Buddha: \u201cThe term \u2018neither reappears nor does not reappear\u2019 does not apply, Vaccha.\u201d</p>\n<p>Not comprehending the Blessed One's response, Vaccha admitted:</p>\n<p>\u201cMaster Gotama, I have fallen into confusion, and the confidence I had gained through my previous conversation with you has now disappeared.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Blessed One then used the beautiful simile of fire to explain enlightenment:</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you think, Vaccha? Suppose a fire were burning before you. Would you know: \u2018This fire is burning before me\u2019?\u201d</p>\n<p>Vaccha: \u201cI would, Master Gotama.\u201d</p>\n<p>Buddha: \u201cIf someone were to ask you, Vaccha: \u2018What does this fire burn in dependence on?\u2019 what would you answer?\u201d</p>\n<p>Vaccha: \u201cI would answer: \u2018This fire burns in dependence on fuel of grass and sticks.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>Buddha: \u201cIf that fire were to be extinguished, would you know: \u2018This fire before me has been extinguished\u2019?\u201d</p>\n<p>Vaccha: \u201cI would, Master Gotama.\u201d</p>\n<p>Buddha: \u201cIf someone were to ask you, Vaccha: \u2018When that fire was extinguished, to which direction did it go: east, west, north, or south?\u2019 what would you answer?\u201d</p>\n<p>Vaccha: \u201cThat does not apply, Master Gotama. The fire burned in dependence on fuel of grass and sticks. When that fuel was used up, if it did not get any more fuel, being without fuel, it is reckoned as extinguished.\u201d</p>\n<p>Through the simile of the extinguished fire, the Blessed One demonstrated the pointlessness of speculative views regarding the destiny of an enlightened being. Vaccha became a follower of the Buddha and, later, when he attained arahant-hood, he praised the Buddha, saying:</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Blessed One has been worshipped by me, the Sublime One has been worshipped by me.\u201d</p>\n<h2>The Buddha and His Disciples:</h2>\n<p>The following incident shows how his disciples regarded the Buddha as their teacher. It demonstrates the Buddha\u2019s humility and also that his disciples did not worship him as a god or super-human, rather simply a teacher, who discovered the spiritual path and showed it them.</p>\n<h3>With Venerable S\u0101riputta</h3>\n<p>On one occasion, during the Pav\u0101ra\u1e47\u0101 <span id=\"Endnote11\">[<a href=\"#endnote11\">11</a>]</span> ceremony, the Blessed One invited his disciples to point out any faults in his conduct. Venerable S\u0101riputta, after paying homage to the Buddha, responded:</p>\n<p><i>\"Venerable sir, there is no bodily or verbal misconduct in the Blessed One that we could possibly censure. The Blessed One is the originator of the path that had not arisen before, the revealer of the path that had not been declared before.

Though firmly established in the human world, he surpasses even the most exalted deities through his supreme wisdom and perfect purity.</p>\n<p>In the deep stillness of the night, while the rest of the world sleeps, devas often visit the Buddha\u2014sometimes to recite verses in his praise, sometimes to ask profound questions. When they approach, they almost always bow in homage, recognizing the Buddha as their spiritual and moral superior.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As Bhikkhu Bodhi writes:<b> </b><span id=\"Endnote13\">[<a href=\"#endnote13\">13</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"The Buddha towers above the most exalted deities by reason of his supreme wisdom and perfect purity.\"</p>\n<p>Devas, <span id=\"Endnote14\">[<a href=\"#endnote14\">14</a>]</span> Brahmas  <span id=\"Endnote15\">[<a href=\"#endnote15\">15</a>]</span>, and Yakkas s\u2019 <span id=\"Endnote16\">[<a href=\"#endnote16\">16</a>]</span> alike accepted the Buddha as a great and wise teacher, inspired by his purity and universal knowledge. The following are some of the encounters the Blessed One had with them:</p>\n<h2>The Buddha and Sakka, Ruler of the Gods</h2>\n<p>On one occasion, Sakka, the ruler of the gods, approached the Blessed One and asked:<i> </i><span id=\"Endnote17\">[<a href=\"#endnote17\">17</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\"Why do beings long for peace and harmony, yet live in conflict, harming one another?\"</i></p>\n<p>The Buddha replied:</p>\n<p><b>\"</b><i>It is because of jealousy and greed that beings live in hatred, causing harm to one another.\"</i></p>\n<p>But Sakka did not stop there\u2014he continued to ask deeper questions, unraveling a chain of causation. The Buddha explained:</p>\n<p>\"Jealousy and greed arise due to attachment and aversion. Attachment and aversion, in turn, stem from craving, which itself arises from unwise thinking and mental preoccupation. This thinking leads to mental proliferation. But when one follows the right path\u2014aligned with the Dhamma\u2014such proliferation ceases.\"</p>\n<p>The Blessed One then pointed out the path leading to the cessation of all proliferation, and Sakka understood the Dhamma.</p>\n<p><i>\"And as he listened to this discourse, the pure and spotless Dhamma-Eye arose within Sakka, the ruler of the gods. He realized: \u2018Whatever arises is subject to cessation.\u2019\"</i></p>\n<p>Filled with joy, Sakka praised the Buddha with these words:</p>\n<p>\u201c I have seen the Buddha, and my doubts are dispelled, my fears have vanished.</p>\n<p>To the Enlightened One, I pay homage, to him who has drawn out the dart of craving.</p>\n<p>To the Buddha, the peerless Lord, the mighty hero, the kinsman of the Sun!</p>\n<p>Just as Brahm\u0101 is worshipped by the gods, so too today we worship you,</p>\n<p>Enlightened One, the unsurpassed Teacher\u2014none can equal you,</p>\n<p>In the human world or among the gods!\" <span id=\"Endnote18\">[<a href=\"#endnote18\">18</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page7/image2.png\" />\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>Sakka the ruler of the devas\u2019 listening to a discourse by the Buddha</b>.<span id=\"Endnote19\">[<a href=\"#endnote19\">19</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>The Buddha Taming \u0100\u1e37avaka the Yakkha</h2>\n<p>The scriptures recount how the Buddha, with his unique patience and skilful teaching methods, subdued a fierce yakkha. The background story unfolds as follows:</p>\n<p>One day, while hunting in the forest, King \u0100\u1e37avaka of \u0100\u1e37av\u012b was captured by the ferocious Yakkha \u0100\u1e37avaka, who threatened to devour him. The king pleaded for his life and was granted release on one condition\u2014he had to provide the yakkha with a human sacrifice each day.</p>\n<p>At first, the king sent criminals from the royal prison. But when there were no more prisoners left, he decreed that each family in the kingdom must offer a child. Over time, families with children fled the land, leaving the king with no choice but to sacrifice his own son, the young prince of \u0100\u1e37av\u012b. <span id=\"Endnote20\">[<a href=\"#endnote20\">20</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Aware of this impending tragedy, the Buddha, moved by compassion, intervened. On the night before the sacrifice was to take place, he journeyed to the yakkha\u2019s dwelling, determined to turn the fearsome being away from his cruel ways.</p>\n<p>At that time, \u0100\u1e37avaka was away, attending a gathering of yakkhas in the Himalayas. The Buddha entered his cave, took a seat upon the yakkha\u2019s throne, and began preaching the Dhamma to the demon\u2019s consorts.</p>\n<p>When \u0100\u1e37avaka heard of this, he was overcome with rage. In a fury, he rushed back to \u0100\u1e37av\u012b and demanded that the Blessed One leave at once\u2026<span id=\"Endnote21\">[<a href=\"#endnote21\">21</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u0100\u1e37avaka the Yakkha arrived at his dwelling and saw the Buddha seated there. He commanded, \u201cGet out, ascetic!\u201d</p>\n<p>The Buddha calmly replied, \u201cAll right, friend,\u201d and stepped outside. Then the yakkha ordered, \u201cCome in, ascetic!\u201d and the Blessed One re-entered.</p>\n<p>This exchange happened three times. The Buddha complied each time, knowing that yielding would be the most effective way to soften the yakkha\u2019s mind. However, when \u0100\u1e37avaka intended to keep sending him in and out all night, the Master firmly refused, saying, \u201cI will not go out, friend. Do whatever you must.\u201d <span id=\"Endnote22\">[<a href=\"#endnote22\">22</a>]</span></p>\n<p>Enraged, the yakkha threatened him:</p>\n<p>\u201c I will question you, ascetic. If you fail to answer, I will drive you insane, split your heart, or seize you by the feet and hurl you across the Ganges!\u201d</p>\n<p>Yet the Blessed One remained unshaken and replied:</p>\n<p>\u201cFriend, in this world\u2014with its devas, M\u0101ra, and Brahm\u0101; among this generation of ascetics and brahmins, devas and humans\u2014I see no one who could drive me insane, split my heart, or seize me by the feet and hurl me across the Ganges. Ask whatever you wish.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u0100\u1e37avaka then questioned the Buddha about truthfulness, wisdom, self-control, generosity, duty, patience, and more. As he listened to the Master\u2019s profound answers, he became satisfied and deeply moved.</p>\n<p>Finally, he declared: \u201cWhy should I now seek answers from other ascetics and brahmins? Today, I have realized what truly benefits the future life. Indeed, it was for my sake that the Buddha came to reside at \u0100\u1e37av\u012b. Now I understand where a gift bears great fruit\u2026 From this day forward, I shall go from village to village, town to town, paying homage to the Enlightened One and the excellence of the Dhamma.\u201d  <span id=\"Endnote23\">[<a href=\"#endnote23\">23</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page7/image3.jpeg\" />\n<p></p>\n<p><b>Taming of \u0100\u1e37avaka Yakkha by the Blessed One</b><span id=\"Endnote24\">[<a href=\"#endnote24\">24</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page7/image4.jpeg\" />\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>The Dhamma Chakka Mudr\u0101<span id=\"Endnote25\">[<a href=\"#endnote25\">25</a>]</span></h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>Tradition holds that when the Blessed One teaches, he keeps his hands in a specific gesture known as the Dhamma Chakka Mudr\u0101\u2014the gesture of turning the Wheel of Dhamma. He first used it while delivering his inaugural sermon at Deer Park in Isipatana.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Buddha and Brahma Baka<b> </b><span id=\"Endnote26\">[<a href=\"#endnote26\">26</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>According to the scriptures, Brahma Baka, after dwelling for countless eons in the Brahma world, developed the mistaken view that his existence there was supreme and eternal. Seeing this with his divine insight, the Blessed One, out of compassion, vanished from Jeta\u2019s Grove and reappeared in Brahma Baka\u2019s realm. <span id=\"Endnote27\">[<a href=\"#endnote27\">27</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Engaging in dialogue with Brahma Baka, the Buddha revealed that, despite the immense lifespan of beings in the Brahma world, it too was impermanent. He recounted Brahm\u0101 Baka\u2019s past lives and the many meritorious deeds he had performed. By the end of the discourse, Brahma Baka realized the truth and abandoned his mistaken view of permanence. Bowing before the Blessed One, he declared:</p>\n<p><i>\"Surely, you know the span of my life,</p>\n<p>And the lives of others too; thus, you are the Buddha.</p>\n<p>Such is your radiant majesty,</p>\n<p>That even the Brahma world is illumined by your light.\" </i><span id=\"Endnote28\">[<a href=\"#endnote28\">28</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>The Buddha as a Wise Teacher</h2>\n<p>As a wise and compassionate teacher, the Buddha always listened carefully to others. If their words were reasonable and true, he praised them and accepted their insights. This quality is evident in several instances from the scriptures:</p>\n<h3>The Buddha Acknowledges Deva T\u0101yana</h3>\n<p>On one occasion, a young deva named T\u0101yana approached the Buddha, paid homage to him, and recited verses about the holy life. The following day, the Buddha shared this encounter with the Sa\u1e45gha and instructed the bhikkhus:</p>\n<p><i>\u201c\u2026learn T\u0101yana\u2019s verses, bhikkhus\u2026Remember T\u0101yana\u2019s verses\u2026T\u0101yana\u2019s verses are beneficial, bhikkhus, they pertain to the fundamentals of the holy life.\u201d </i><span id=\"Endnote29\">[<a href=\"#endnote29\">29</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Buddha Praises Bhikkhun\u012b Dhammadinn\u0101<b> </b><span id=\"Endnote30\">[<a href=\"#endnote30\">30</a>]</span><b> </b></p>\n<p>Once, Vis\u0101kha, <span id=\"Endnote31\">[<a href=\"#endnote31\">31</a>]</span> a devoted lay follower and non-returner, approached Venerable Bhikkhun\u012b Dhammadinn\u0101, paid homage to her, and asked profound questions regarding identity view and liberation. The bhikkhun\u012b gave clear and insightful answers, deeply impressing Vis\u0101kha.</p>\n<p>He later visited the Buddha and recounted his conversation with Bhikkhun\u012b Dhammadinn\u0101. The Blessed One praised her wisdom, affirming her discourse as the true teaching of the Buddha, saying:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cBhikkhun\u012b Dhammadinn\u0101 is wise, Vis\u0101kha.</p>\n<p>She has great wisdom. If you had asked me these questions,</p>\n<p>I would have answered them exactly as she did.</p>\n<p>This is the correct meaning, and so you should remember it.\u201d</i> <span id=\"Endnote32\">[<a href=\"#endnote32\">32</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h1>The Buddha\u2019s Teaching: A Path to Liberation from Suffering</h1>\n<p>Throughout the scriptures, it is evident that the Buddha\u2019s primary purpose was to guide beings away from suffering. Understanding human nature deeply, he sometimes employed unconventional methods to help them realize the Dhamma for themselves.</p>\n<p>The following accounts illustrate the Buddha\u2019s skill and boundless compassion\u2014his ability to perceive the suffering of beings and lead them toward peace.</p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page7/image5.jpeg\" />\n<p></p>\n<p><b>Kis\u0101 Gotam\u012b besieging the Buddha to bring her dead son back to life.</b><span id=\"Endnote33\">[<a href=\"#endnote33\">33</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Story of Bhikkhun\u012b Kis\u0101 Gotam\u012b <span id=\"Endnote34\">[<a href=\"#endnote34\">34</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>During the time when the Blessed One resided in S\u0101vatthi, a woman named Kis\u0101 Gotam\u012b lived in a nearby village. She came from a poor family and, after marriage, moved into the home of her wealthy husband. However, because she had not brought a large dowry, her new relatives treated her with little respect.</p>\n<p>Everything changed when she gave birth to a son. Now, as the mother of the family\u2019s heir, her status improved, and life became easier. She loved her child deeply\u2014he was her whole world.</p>\n<p>But tragedy struck. The little boy fell ill and, despite all efforts, passed away. Kis\u0101 Gotam\u012b, overwhelmed with grief, refused to accept his death. Holding her child\u2019s lifeless body in her arms, she wandered from house to house, desperately pleading for a physician who could cure him. Her mind, clouded by sorrow, could not grasp the reality of impermanence.</p>\n<p>Seeing her in this state, a kind villager took pity on her and gently suggested, \"Go to the Blessed One at Jetavana Monastery. He is a great physician\u2014he may have a cure for your child.\"</p>\n<p>With renewed hope, Kis\u0101 Gotam\u012b hurried to the monastery. Falling at the Buddha\u2019s feet, she begged, \"Please, Blessed One, heal my son!\"</p>\n<p>The Buddha, in his boundless wisdom and compassion, did not deny her request outright. Instead, understanding her suffering, he offered a task:</p>\n<p>\"Bring me a few mustard seeds from any household,\" he said, \"but the seeds must come from a home that has never known death.\"</p>\n<p>Filled with hope, Kis\u0101 Gotam\u012b set off at once, going door to door in search of the mustard seeds.</p>\n<p>At the first house, the family readily agreed to give her some. Just before taking them, she asked, \"Has anyone ever died in this house?\"</p>\n<p>The family replied, \"Yes, our father passed away recently.\"</p>\n<p>Disheartened, but still determined, she moved to the next house. Again, they were willing to give her mustard seeds, but when she asked the same question, she received the same response\u2014someone in their family had died.</p>\n<p>House after house, she searched, but everywhere, death had left its mark.</p>\n<p>As she continued her journey, a realization began to dawn upon her. No house was free from death. No family was untouched by loss. Finally, she understood the deeper meaning behind the Buddha\u2019s request. It had never been about the mustard seeds. The Blessed One had gently guided her to see the universal truth\u2014all who are born must one day pass away.</p>\n<p>Her sorrow transformed into wisdom. Carrying her child\u2019s body to the cremation ground, she bid him farewell and let go of her grief. Then, with a heart opened to the truth, she returned to the Buddha.</p>\n<p>The Blessed One taught her the Dhamma, revealing the nature of existence and the path to liberation. Kis\u0101 Gotam\u012b, deeply moved, renounced her lay life and became a bhikkhun\u012b. Diligently practicing according to the Dhamma, she attained arahantship\u2014the state of complete liberation.</p>\n<p>Her realization was so profound that when M\u0101ra, the Evil One, attempted to shake her resolve, she remained unshaken. In the <i>Sa\u1e43yutta Nik\u0101ya (SN: Bhikkhun\u012b Sa\u1e43yutta)</i>, we find the verses of Venerable Kis\u0101 Gotam\u012b, fearlessly confronting M\u0101ra himself:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>M\u0101ra said:</p>\n<p>\"Why now, when your son is dead,</p>\n<p>Do you sit alone with tearful face?</p>\n<p>Having entered the woods all alone,</p>\n<p>Are you searching for a man?\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The bhikkhun\u012b replied:</p>\n<p>\"I have moved beyond the death of sons;</p>\n<p>With that, the search for men has ended.</p>\n<p>I do not sorrow, I do not weep,</p>\n<p>Nor do I fear you, friend!\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Realizing that Bhikkhun\u012b Kis\u0101 Gotam\u012b had seen through his deception, M\u0101ra, disappointed and defeated, vanished on the spot. Thus, through wisdom and insight, Kis\u0101 Gotam\u012b transcended grief and attained the highest peace\u2014Nibb\u0101na.<span id=\"Endnote35\">[<a href=\"#endnote35\">35</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Taming Angulim\u0101la -The Serial Killer Who Became an Arahant <span id=\"Endnote36\">[<a href=\"#endnote36\">36</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>During his time in Jeta\u2019s Grove, S\u0101vatth\u012b, the Blessed One became aware of a notorious bandit named Angulim\u0101la, who terrorized the forests of the Kosala region. Angulim\u0101la had been deceived by a corrupt teacher into believing that he needed to collect a thousand human fingers as an offering. Merciless in his pursuit, he had already claimed 999 victims\u2014only one more was needed to complete his gruesome garland.</p>\n<p>With his divine eye, the Buddha saw that Angulim\u0101la\u2019s own mother was unknowingly walking toward the forest, about to become his final victim. But the Blessed One also perceived something even more profound\u2014Angulim\u0101la had the potential to attain arahantship. Moved by boundless compassion, the Buddha set out to intercept him, determined to prevent a matricide, one of the five most heinous crimes that lead to immediate rebirth in hell.</p>\n<p>As the Buddha walked calmly along the forest path, Angulim\u0101la spotted him and rushed forward with his sword drawn, ready to claim his final finger. But something astonishing happened\u2014the Blessed One, walking at his normal pace, remained impossibly out of reach. No matter how fast Angulim\u0101la ran, he could not close the distance. Bewildered, he thought:</p>\n<p>\u201cHow incredible! I have chased down swift elephants, galloping horses, and even fleeing deer, yet though I run with all my strength, I cannot catch this recluse, who simply walks.\u201d</p>\n<p>Realizing the futility of his pursuit, he called out in frustration:</p>\n<p>\"Stop, recluse! Stop, recluse!\"</p>\n<p>The Buddha turned and replied with words that would change Angulim\u0101la\u2019s life forever:</p>\n<p>\"I have stopped, Angulim\u0101la. You stop too.\"</p>\n<p>Confused, Angulim\u0101la asked,</p>\n<p>\"But you are still walking, recluse. How can you say you have stopped? And how can you claim that I have not?\"</p>\n<p>With serene wisdom, the Buddha answered:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"Angulim\u0101la, I have stopped forever.</p>\n<p>I abstain from harming any living being.</p>\n<p>But you have not stopped\u2014you continue to take life.</p>\n<p>That is why I have stopped, and you have not.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>At that moment, the truth struck Angulim\u0101la like lightning. The veil of ignorance that had shrouded his mind for so long was lifted. He saw, with absolute clarity, the horror of his deeds and the futility of his violence.</p>\n<p>Recognizing that this monk was none other than the Buddha himself, he threw down his sword and fell to his knees. With a heart filled with remorse and reverence, he bowed at the feet of the Blessed One and begged for ordination.</p>\n<p>The Buddha, the great teacher of boundless compassion, the refuge of the world with its gods and men, simply said:</p>\n<p>\"Come, bhikkhu.\"</p>\n<p>With these words, Angulim\u0101la was instantly ordained into the monastic order. <span id=\"Endnote37\">[<a href=\"#endnote37\">37</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>From that moment on, the man who had once been a ruthless killer devoted himself fully to the path of the Dhamma. Through dedicated practice, he transformed his mind, and before long, he attained arahantship\u2014perfect liberation.</p>\n<p>Thus, the most feared bandit of the land became one of the most revered disciples in the Buddha\u2019s dispensation, proving that no one is beyond redemption when met with wisdom and compassion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"page7/image6.jpeg\" />\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p class=\"caption\"><b>Angulimala running after the Buddha</b><span id=\"Endnote38\">[<a href=\"#endnote38\">38</a>]</span><b> </b></p>\n<h1>The Blessed One\u2019s Mastery of Teaching</h1>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Bhikkhu Bodhi eloquently describes the Buddha\u2019s extraordinary teaching abilities: <span id=\"Endnote39\">[<a href=\"#endnote39\">39</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cAs a skilled and versatile teacher, the Buddha adopted different styles of presentation to communicate the Dhamma to his disciples. Often, he would explain a teaching in detail (vitth\u0101rena). Having introduced his topic with a short statement or synopsis (uddesa), he would then elaborate (niddesa), analyzing it, drawing out its implications, and sometimes using similes (upam\u0101) to reinforce his point. Finally, he would restate his declaration as a conclusion (niggamana), now supported by the full weight of his analysis.\u201d</p>\n<p><b>\u201c</b>At other times, however, the Buddha would teach briefly (sa\u1e41khittena), offering only a concise, sometimes cryptic statement, rich with profound meaning. This was not to conceal an esoteric message but because brevity, in certain cases, was more effective in shaking and transforming the minds of his listeners. The purpose of his teachings was not merely to convey information but to inspire insight, wisdom, and liberation. By requiring his disciples to reflect deeply, engage in inquiry, and discuss the teachings, the Buddha ensured that his words would lead them toward true understanding\u201d</p>\n<h2>The Blessed One Taught in Both Brief and Detailed Ways</h2>\n<p>The Buddha himself affirmed:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cS\u0101riputta, I can teach the Dhamma briefly; I can teach the Dhamma in detail; I can teach the Dhamma both briefly and in detail. But those who can truly understand are rare.\u201d </i><span id=\"Endnote40\">[<a href=\"#endnote40\">40</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Before teaching, the Buddha carefully considered his audience, assessing their capacity to comprehend the Dhamma. With his extraordinary ability to perceive the spiritual maturity of beings (<i>indriya-paropariyatte \u00f1\u0101na</i>), <span id=\"Endnote41\">[<a href=\"#endnote41\">41</a>]</span>  he tailored his teachings accordingly. For those who needed extensive explanations, he expounded in detail with stories and similes. For those with keen wisdom, a brief but profound statement sufficed. Always, his teachings stemmed from great compassion\u2014his sole purpose was to guide beings out of the endless cycle of <i>sams\u0101ra</i> and toward liberation.</p>\n<h2>Two Styles of the Buddha\u2019s Teachings</h2>\n<h3>Detailed Teachings: A Discourse with Subha the Brahmin Student <span id=\"Endnote42\">[<a href=\"#endnote42\">42</a>]</span></h3>\n<p>One time, a young Brahmin student named Subha approached the Blessed One and inquired why some people are born into fortunate circumstances while others suffer misfortune. He asked:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cWhy is it, Master Gotama, that some people are short-lived while others live long? Some are sickly while others are healthy, some ugly while others are beautiful, some poor while others are wealthy, some born into low status while others are highly regarded, and some foolish while others are wise?\u201d</i></p>\n<p>The Buddha responded:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cStudent, beings are the heirs of their actions, born from their actions, bound to their actions, and have their actions as their refuge. It is action (kamma) that distinguishes beings as inferior or superior.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>He then explained in detail:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\t<b>Lifespan:</b> Those who harm and kill others are reborn in unfortunate realms; if they return to the human world, they suffer short lives. But those who cultivate compassion and refrain from harming beings enjoy long lives when reborn as humans.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\t<b>Health:</b> Those who injure and torment others suffer illness in future lives, while those who protect and care for others experience good health.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\t<b>Beauty:</b> Those consumed by anger and hostility are reborn with unattractive features, while those who cultivate kindness and patience are reborn with beauty.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\t<b>Influence:</b> The envious and jealous are reborn without status or power, while those who rejoice in others\u2019 success and live without jealousy gain influence and respect.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\t<b>Wealth:</b> The miserly and greedy experience poverty in future lives, while the generous and charitable find themselves reborn in wealth.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\t<b>Birth Status</b>: Those who are arrogant and fail to honour the honourable are reborn into low status, whereas those who pay respect to the worthy are reborn into esteemed families.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\t<b>Wisdom</b>: Those who neglect to seek wisdom, who refuse to learn from the wise, are reborn foolish. But those who approach the learned, eager to understand wholesome and unwholesome actions, are reborn wise.</p>\n<p>Upon hearing this detailed explanation, Subha gained deep understanding of the workings of <i>kamma</i> and expressed his gratitude to the Buddha, becoming his devoted follower.<span id=\"Endnote43\">[<a href=\"#endnote43\">43</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Blessed One, with boundless wisdom and compassion, taught the Dhamma in ways suited to the needs of each being\u2014whether in depth or in brief\u2014always guiding them toward the path of liberation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>With the K\u0101l\u0101mas of Kesaputta<b> </b><span id=\"Endnote44\">[<a href=\"#endnote44\">44</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The K\u0101l\u0101mas of Kesaputta were a clan known for their intellect.

We are perplexed and in doubt, Bhante\u2014how do we discern who speaks the truth and who speaks falsehood?\u201d</p>\n<p>The Buddha replied:</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is natural to be perplexed and to experience doubt when faced with uncertainty. Come, K\u0101l\u0101mas, do not accept something merely because it has been handed down through oral tradition, lineage, hearsay, or scripture. Do not rely on logical reasoning, inference, or deep contemplation alone. Do not accept something simply because it seems convincing or because the speaker appears competent. And do not believe something merely out of respect for your teacher.</p>\n<p>But when you know for yourselves: \u2018These things are unwholesome, blameworthy, and censured by the wise; if undertaken and practiced, they lead to harm and suffering,\u2019 then you should abandon them.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Buddha then explained what was meant by the unwholesome. He identified three roots of all immoral conduct and defiled states of mind: greed, hatred, and delusion.</p>\n<p>He asked the K\u0101l\u0101mas:</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you think, K\u0101l\u0101mas? When greed arises in a person, is it for their welfare or their harm?\u201d</p>\n<p>They replied:</p>\n<p>\u201cFor their harm, Bhante.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Buddha continued:</p>\n<p>\u201cA person consumed by greed, whose mind is overwhelmed by it, destroys life, takes what is not given, commits adultery, and speaks falsehood. They also encourage others to do likewise. Does this lead to harm and suffering for a long time?\u201d</p>\n<p>The K\u0101l\u0101mas affirmed:</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, Bhante.\u201d</p>\n<p>The same was applied to hatred and delusion. The Buddha asked if these states led to harm and suffering, and the K\u0101l\u0101mas agreed. Then he extended his teaching further, guiding them to understand that abandoning greed, hatred, and delusion is the path to well-being.</p>\n<p>The Blessed One then said:</p>\n<p>\u201cThus, K\u0101l\u0101mas, when I said: \u2018<b>Do not go by oral tradition \u2026 but when you know for yourselves that something is unwholesome, blameworthy, and censured by the wise\u2014when you see that it leads to harm and suffering\u2014you should abandon it,\u2019 I spoke for this reason</b>.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Buddha then inquired whether the absence of greed, hatred, and delusion would be beneficial. The K\u0101l\u0101mas agreed that the cultivation of wholesome qualities brings happiness, both to oneself and to others. The Blessed One then expounded on the benefits of wholesome actions and how the abandonment of unwholesome states leads to true liberation. In this way, he guided the K\u0101l\u0101mas toward the Dhamma\u2014not by demanding blind faith, but by encouraging their own reflection.</p>\n<p>At the conclusion of the discourse, the K\u0101l\u0101mas, deeply moved, venerated the Blessed One and said:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cExcellent, Bhante! \u2026 We go for refuge to the Blessed One, to the Dhamma, and to the Sa\u1e45gha of bhikkhus. Let the Blessed One consider us lay followers who, from this day forward, have gone for refuge for life.\u201d </i><span id=\"Endnote45\">[<a href=\"#endnote45\">45</a>]</span><i> </i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Brief but Profound Teachings of the Buddha</h2>\n<p>The following encounters illustrate how the Buddha could convey the Dhamma in simple, concise words\u2014brief yet deeply profound. To highlight these succinct yet powerful teachings, we have selected the following extracts from the scriptures:</p>\n<h3> With the Ascetic Bahiya Darichariya <span id=\"Endnote46\">[<a href=\"#endnote46\">46</a>]</span></h3>\n<p>The <i>Ud\u0101na</i> records the story of B\u0101hiya as follows: <span id=\"Endnote47\">[<a href=\"#endnote47\">47</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling near S\u0101vatth\u012b, in Jeta\u2019s Grove at An\u0101thapi\u1e47\u1e0dika\u2019s monastery. At that same time, B\u0101hiya of the Bark Robe was living near Supp\u0101raka, on the ocean\u2019s shore, venerated by many.</p>\n<p>One day, while in seclusion, B\u0101hiya reflected:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cAmong those in the world who are Worthy Ones or who have entered the path to Worthiness, I am one of them.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>A devat\u0101, who had been a relative of B\u0101hiya in a past life, perceived his thoughts and, out of compassion, came to him and said:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cB\u0101hiya, you are certainly not a Worthy One, nor is this practice of yours the path to Worthiness.\u201d</i></p>\n<p><i>When B\u0101hiya asked who a true Worthy One was, the devat\u0101 replied:</i></p>\n<p><i>\u201cIn the northern lands, there is a city called S\u0101vatth\u012b. There, at this very moment, dwells the Gracious One\u2014a Perfectly Enlightened Buddha\u2014who teaches the Dhamma for attaining Worthiness.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>Shaken by the devat\u0101\u2019s words, B\u0101hiya resolved to seek out the Buddha. Without delay, he undertook the long journey and eventually arrived at An\u0101thapi\u1e47\u1e0dika\u2019s monastery. Upon inquiring about the Blessed One, the monks informed him that the Buddha had gone to S\u0101vatth\u012b for alms.</p>\n<p>Eager to meet the Buddha, B\u0101hiya ran to the city and, upon seeing the Blessed One, approached, venerated him, and urgently requested Dhamma instruction. The Buddha, having already entered the village for alms, replied that it was not the proper time for teaching. B\u0101hiya, however, pleaded three times, each time receiving the same response. Yet, undeterred, he begged once more.</p>\n<p>At that moment, the Buddha saw with his divine vision that B\u0101hiya\u2019s life was nearing its end. Moved by great compassion, he taught him the Dhamma right then and there:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cB\u0101hiya, you should train yourself thus: In what is seen, let there be only what is seen; in what is heard, only what is heard; in what is sensed, only what is sensed; in what is cognized, only what is cognized. This is how you should train yourself\u2026\u201d</i></p>\n<p><i>\u201cWhen, B\u0101hiya, in what is seen there is only what is seen, in what is heard only what is heard, in what is sensed only what is sensed, in what is cognized only what is cognized\u2014then, you will not be \u2018with that.\u2019 Since you will not be \u2018with that,\u2019 you will not be \u2018in that.\u2019 Since you will not be \u2018in that,\u2019 you will not be here, nor hereafter, nor in between the two. Just this is the end of suffering.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>Upon hearing these words, B\u0101hiya\u2019s mind was instantly liberated from all attachment. Shortly afterward, he was killed by a cow.</p>\n<p>When the monks informed the Buddha of B\u0101hiya\u2019s passing, he instructed them to cremate his remains and erect a stupa in his honour. The Blessed One then declared B\u0101hiya D\u0101ruc\u012briya the disciple who attained direct knowledge in the shortest time. <span id=\"Endnote48\">[<a href=\"#endnote48\">48</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>With the Ascetic Tissametteiya <span id=\"Endnote49\">[<a href=\"#endnote49\">49</a>]</span></h2>\n<p>On one occasion approaching the Buddha, ascetic Tissametteiya asked:</p>\n<p>\u201cWho in this world is truly content?</p>\n<p>Who remains undisturbed?</p>\n<p>Which wise one, having understood both ends, is not caught in the middle?</p>\n<p>Who is regarded as a great man?</p>\n<p>Who has escaped the seamstress?\u201d</p>\n<p>The Buddha replied:</p>\n<p>\u201cOne who leads the spiritual life amidst sensual pleasures, yet remains free from craving\u2014ever mindful and fully quenched\u2014such a mendicant has no disturbances.</p>\n<p>That thoughtful one, having known both ends, is not stuck in the middle.</p>\n<p>He is a great man, I declare; he has escaped the seamstress.\u201d</p>\n<p><b>Notes:</b></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>On the Seamstress: The Buddha explained:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cContact, bhikkhus, is one end; the arising of contact is the second end; the cessation of contact is in the middle. And craving is the seamstress, for craving sews one to the production of this or that state of existence.</p>\n<p>It is in this way that a bhikkhu directly knows what should be known, fully understands what should be understood, and, by doing so, in this very life, brings suffering to an end.\u201d <span id=\"Endnote50\">[<a href=\"#endnote50\">50</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Buddha and the arahants are called great men because they have escaped the seamstress\u2014craving\u2014thus freeing themselves from the cycle of existence.</p>\n<p>In the next section (8) we will focus on praise and criticism bestowed to the Buddha by various beings of this world</p>\n<h3>End Note: Section 7</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<span id=\"endnote1\">[<a href=\"#Endnote1\">1</a>]</span>\t AI generated image.\n<p></p>\n<span id=\"endnote2\">[<a href=\"#Endnote2\">2</a>]</span>\t The 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, spiritual leader of Tibet.

While some of them chose to follow him, others did not. Among the most powerful religious sects of the time were the Brahmins and Jains. The scriptures often depict how some of their members opposed the Buddha and his teachings, while others recognized him as a great teacher worthy of respect.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Niga\u1e47\u1e6dha N\u0101taputta\u2019s Displeasure</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>In the <i>Upali Sutta</i> (MN:56), we find a statement from Niga\u1e47\u1e6dha N\u0101taputta, the leader of the Jain sect, who, upon hearing that his former pupil Upali had become a follower of the Buddha, expressed his displeasure. He said:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\u201cHouseholder, you are mad, you are an imbecile. You went saying, \u2018Venerable sir, I shall refute the recluse Gotama\u2019s doctrine,\u2019 and you have come back caught in the vast net of his doctrine. Just as if a man went to castrate someone and came back castrated himself, or went to put out someone\u2019s eyes and came back with his own eyes put out\u2014so too, householder, you went saying, \u2018Venerable sir, I shall refute the recluse Gotama\u2019s doctrine,\u2019 and you have returned caught in the vast net of his teachings. Householder, you have been converted by the recluse Gotama with his converting magic!\u201d</i></p>\n<h3>Brahmin Vera\u00f1j\u0101\u2019s Criticism </h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>In the Vera\u00f1j\u0101 Sut<i>ta</i> (AN8:11), a Brahmin from Vera\u00f1j\u0101 approached the Buddha, accusing him of improper conduct for not paying homage to elderly Brahmins and other perceived failings. He listed eight reasons for his disapproval of the Buddha:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1)\tThe ascetic Gotama does not pay homage to elderly Brahmins.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2)\tHe is not hospitable.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>3)\tHe is an advocate of non-doing.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>4)\tHe is an annihilationist.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>5)\tHe is a repeller.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>6)\tHe is an abolitionist.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>7)\tHe is a tormentor.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>8)\tHe is retiring.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>After listening to the Brahmin, the Buddha gave a lengthy discourse, skillfully addressing each of the eight points. At the end of the discourse, Brahmin Vera\u00f1j\u0101, having gained a deeper understanding, changed his view. He declared:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\u201cMaster Gotama is the eldest... he is the best! Excellent, Master Gotama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways. I now go for refuge to Master Gotama.\u201d</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Through his teachings, the Buddha transformed the hearts and minds of those who came into contact with him, even those from opposing religious sects. His wisdom and compassion were so compelling that they won the respect and admiration of many, leading even those who initially opposed him to recognize the truth of his teachings.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Da\u1e47\u1e0dap\u0101ni the Sakyan\u2019s attitude</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>In the following passage from the <i>Madhupi\u1e47\u1e0dika Sutta</i> (MN:18), we see how Da\u1e47\u1e0dap\u0101ni, <span id=\"Endnote31\">[<a href=\"#endnote31\">31</a>]</span> an elderly Sakyan, failed to respect or believe the teachings of the Buddha, despite the fact that the Buddha hailed from his own clan:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>On one occasion, the Blessed One was in the Sakyan country at Kapilavatthu, in Nigrodha\u2019s Park. Da\u1e47\u1e0dap\u0101ni, the Sakyan, met the Buddha and asked,</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>What does the recluse assert, what does he proclaim?\u201d</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Buddha replied,</p>\n<p><i>\u201cFriend, I assert and proclaim my teaching in such a way that one does not quarrel with anyone in the world, with its gods, its people, or anyone else.\u201d</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Upon hearing this, Da\u1e47\u1e0dap\u0101ni the Sakyan shook his head, wagged his tongue, and raised his eyebrows, causing his forehead to wrinkle in three lines. Afterward, he departed, leaning on his stick.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Sakulud\u0101yin the Wanderer Praises the Buddha<b> </b><span id=\"Endnote32\">[<a href=\"#endnote32\">32</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>On one occasion, the Buddha met Sakulud\u0101yin at his monastery in Peacocks\u2019 Sanctuary. After greeting the Buddha, Sakulud\u0101yin expressed admiration for how the disciples of the Buddha honored, respected, revered, and venerated him, unlike the followers of other religious sects who did not show the same devotion to their teachers. He said:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cVenerable Sir, I see five qualities in the Blessed One that inspire his disciples to honor, respect, revere, and venerate him, living in dependence on him\u2026\u201d</i><span id=\"Endnote33\">[<a href=\"#endnote33\">33</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>He then described the five qualities as follows:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1)\tThe Blessed One eats little and commends eating little;</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2)\tHe is content with any kind of robe and commends contentment with any kind of robe;</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>3)\tHe is content with any kind of almsfood and commends contentment with any kind of almsfood;</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>4)\tHe is content with any kind of resting place and commends contentment with any kind of resting place;</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>5)\tHe is secluded and commends seclusion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Buddha then explained to Sakulud\u0101yin another set of five qualities, which inspire his disciples to honor, respect, revere, and venerate him, and to live in dependence on him:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Ud\u0101yin, my disciples esteem me for:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1)\tMy higher virtue;</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2)\tMy excellent knowledge and vision;</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>3)\tMy higher wisdom;</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>4)\tWhen my disciples encounter suffering, they come to me and ask me. I explain to them the Four Noble Truths;</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>5)\tI teach them the way to develop wholesome states of mind.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>These, Ud\u0101yin, are the five qualities for which my disciples honor, respect, revere, and venerate me, living in dependence on me.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Although Sakulud\u0101yin could not become a disciple of the Buddha at that time, he greatly admired him. Tradition holds that in a future life, he became a great arahant.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Sunakkhatta the Licchavi Blaming the Buddha</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>Sunakkhatta, a member of the Licchavi clan from Vesali, became a disciple of the Buddha and served as his attendant for a time. He once requested the Blessed One to perform miracles and explain the origins of things. However, when the Buddha declined, Sunakkhatta became disheartened and left the Sangha. In his discontent, he made deceptive statements about the Buddha, saying:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\u201cThe recluse Gotama does not possess any superhuman qualities or any distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones. The recluse Gotama teaches a Dhamma merely derived from reasoning, following his own line of inquiry as it occurs to him. And when he teaches the Dhamma to anyone, it leads them, upon practice, to the complete destruction of suffering.\u201d </i><span id=\"Endnote34\">[<a href=\"#endnote34\">34</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Wanderer Pilotika\u2019s Commendation of the Buddha</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>On one occasion, Brahmin J\u0101\u1e47usso\u1e47i, knowing that the wanderer Pilotika had visited the Buddha, asked him what he thought about the lucidity of the Buddha\u2019s wisdom. Pilotika replied:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\u201cSir, who am I to know the recluse Gotama\u2019s lucidity of wisdom? One would surely have to be his equal to understand the clarity of his wisdom.\u201d</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Brahmin J\u0101\u1e47usso\u1e47i responded, \u201c<i>Master Vacch\u0101yana praises the recluse Gotama with high praise indeed.\u201d</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Pilotika answered, \u201c<i>Sir, who am I to praise the recluse, Gotama? The recluse Gotama is praised by the praised as the best among gods and humans.\u201d</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Then Brahmin J\u0101\u1e47usso\u1e47i inquired how Pilotika had established such firm confidence in the recluse Gotama. Pilotika explained in detail how he came to trust the Blessed One and said:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\u201c\u2026I saw four footprints of the recluse Gotama, and I came to the conclusion: \u2018The Blessed One is fully enlightened, the Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed One, and the Sangha is practicing the good way.</i>\u201d <i> </i><span id=\"Endnote35\">[<a href=\"#endnote35\">35</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3>Saccaka, the Niga\u1e47\u1e6dha\u2019s Son <span id=\"Endnote36\">[<a href=\"#endnote36\">36</a>]</span></h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>According to the <i>C\u016b\u1e37asaccaka Sutta</i> (MN:35), on one occasion, Saccaka approached Venerable Assaji and asked,</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201c<i>How does the recluse Gotama discipline his disciples?\u201d</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Venerable Assaji replied, but Saccaka disagreed with his answer, saying<i>, \u201cIf we have heard what the recluse Gotama asserts, we have indeed heard something disagreeable. Perhaps, sometime, we might meet Master Gotama and have a conversation with him. Perhaps we might convince him to abandon that misguided view.\u201d</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Saccaka then approached the assembly of Licchavis and invited them to join him in witnessing his upcoming debate with the Buddha, elaborating further:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\u201c\u2026Today there will be a conversation between me and the recluse Gotama. If the recluse Gotama maintains what was said by one of his famous disciples, the bhikkhu named Assaji, then just as a strong man might seize a long-haired ram by the hair and drag it back and forth, so in debate, I will drag the recluse Gotama back and forth, around and around\u2026\u201d</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>According to the scriptures, a debate ensued between the Blessed One and Saccaka. Despite his boasting that he could defeat the Buddha, Saccaka was unable to refute any of the Buddha\u2019s logical arguments. At the end of the debate, he admitted:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\u201cMaster Gotama, we were bold and impudent in thinking we could challenge you in debate. A man might attack a mad elephant and find safety, yet he could not attack Master Gotama and find safety. A man might attack a blazing mass of fire and find safety, yet he could not attack Master Gotama and find safety. A man might attack a terrible poisonous snake and find safety, yet he could not attack Master Gotama and find safety\u2026\u201d </i><span id=\"Endnote37\">[<a href=\"#endnote37\">37</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Potaliya the Householder</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>On one occasion, the Buddha was residing in the town of \u0100pa\u1e47a in Anguttar\u0101pans country when he encountered the householder, Potaliya. At that time, Potaliya had renounced his worldly affairs and considered himself a spiritual person. However, when the Blessed One addressed him as \u201chouseholder,\u201d Potaliya was displeased and angry, saying:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\u201cMaster Gotama, it is neither fitting nor proper that you address me as \u2018householder.\u2019</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Buddha, with compassion, inquired about the reason for Potaliya\u2019s displeasure. Potaliya replied:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\u201cMaster Gotama, I have given up all my wealth, grain, silver, and gold to my children as their inheritance. I no longer involve myself in these matters, and I live simply on food and clothing. This is how I have renounced all my affairs and works.\u201d</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Buddha gently explained that true renunciation in his dispensation was different from what Potaliya had practiced. Realizing the depth of the Buddha\u2019s wisdom, Potaliya, who had some insight, humbly requested the Buddha to elaborate on his teaching of renunciation. The Blessed One shared profound insight, and by the end of the discourse, Potaliya's anger was transformed into reverence. With a heart filled with gratitude, Potaliya said:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\u201cVenerable sir, the Blessed One has inspired in me love for recluses, confidence in recluses, and reverence for recluses\u2026 Master Gotama, you have made the Dhamma clear in so many ways, as though turning upright what had been overthrown, revealing what was hidden, showing the way to one who was lost, or holding up a lamp in the dark for those with eyesight to see forms. I go to Master Gotama for refuge, to the Dhamma, and to the Sangha of bhikkhus.\u201d </i><span id=\"Endnote38\">[<a href=\"#endnote38\">38</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In that moment, Potaliya\u2019s heart opened, and he became a devoted follower of the Buddha, embracing the path to liberation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Ordinary People Blaming and Criticizing the Buddha</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>In the Vinaya Pitaka, it is recorded that when the Buddha was residing in R\u0101jagaha, many young men from Magadha, inspired by his teachings, became his disciples. This led to complaints and criticism from the people of the town:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\u201cThe ascetic Gotama is making us childless; he\u2019s making us widows. He\u2019s breaking up good families! A thousand dreadlocked ascetics have now gone forth because of him, and also these two hundred and fifty wanderers who were disciples of Sa\u00f1caya. All these well-known gentlemen from Magadha are practicing the spiritual life under the ascetic Gotama.\u201d</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Despite the growing number of followers, the Buddha remained focused on his mission of teaching the Dhamma with love and wisdom. His work was misunderstood by many, but he knew the profound impact his teachings would have in the long run.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>On another occasion, while the Buddha was dwelling in R\u0101jagaha, a Brahmin named Akkosaka Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja heard that his fellow Brahmin, a member of the Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja clan, had gone forth into homelessness under the ascetic Gotama. Filled with anger, he approached the Buddha and harshly reviled him with rude words. Yet, the Blessed One, with his boundless compassion and patience, did not respond with anger. Instead, he imparted a brief but powerful teaching: <span id=\"Endnote39\">[<a href=\"#endnote39\">39</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\u201cOne who repays an angry man with anger only makes things worse for himself. But if one does not repay anger with anger, he wins a battle that is hard to win.\u201d</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Upon hearing the Buddha's words, the Brahmin Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja realized the depth of the Buddha\u2019s wisdom and compassion. His heart softened, and he understood that the Buddha was not an enemy to be fought but a compassionate teacher. In that moment, Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja let go of his resentment and became one of the Buddha\u2019s disciples, finding peace and clarity in the Dhamma.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Through this profound encounter, we see how the Buddha\u2019s wisdom transformed even the harshest critics, leading them to the path of understanding, compassion, and ultimately, liberation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>The Buddhas\u2019 empathy</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Buddha, throughout his life, received both praise and blame from people of all walks of life, yet he responded to each with remarkable wisdom, universal compassion, and a deep understanding of human nature. Whether praised as the supreme teacher or criticized by those who misunderstood his path, the Buddha remained unmoved by ego or pride. He understood that human reactions were often shaped by ignorance, fear, or attachment, and he responded with patience, clarity, and empathy.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In the face of praise, the Buddha did not indulge in self-congratulation but recognized that any good attributed to him was a reflection of the Dhamma, the truth he taught. In the face of blame, he did not retaliate but offered teachings that encouraged self-reflection and liberation from suffering. His wisdom allowed him to see beyond superficial judgments and penetrate to the deeper motivations and concerns of those who praised or blamed him.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Buddha\u2019s compassion was not limited to humans; it extended to all beings. His responses were always guided by the understanding that true transformation comes not through force or criticism, but through awakening the mind and heart to the realities of life. In this way, he became the ideal teacher, showing that the path to peace and liberation lies in wisdom, compassion, and equanimity\u2014qualities that transcend all praise and blame.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>With that inspiring note we will end this section.

According to the Dhamma, when a being passes away, they take birth again according to the actions (<i>kamma</i>) they have performed in this life. Wholesome <i>kamma</i> leads to a fortunate rebirth in a higher realm, while unwholesome <i>kamma</i> results in rebirth in a lower state of existence. <span id=\"Endnote1\">[<a href=\"#endnote1\">1</a>]</span></p>\n<p><b>Bhikkhu Bodhi explains:</b></p>\n<p><b>\u201cAccording to the Buddha\u2019s teaching, all beings except the arahants are subject to \u2018renewal of being in the future\u2019 (</b><b><i>punabbhava</i></b><b>), that is, to rebirth.</b> Rebirth, in the Buddhist conception, is not the transmigration of a self or soul but the continuation of a process\u2014a flux of becoming\u2014where successive lives are linked by a causal transmission of influence rather than by substantial identity.

The Buddha, knowing his thoughts and moved by compassion, appeared in the Brahma world to dispel his delusion. In their discourse, the Blessed One revealed that in a past life, Brahma Baka had been his teacher, and he, as the Bodhisattva, had been Baka\u2019s devoted attendant named Kappa.</p>\n<p><i>\u201cI was your apprentice named Kappa;</p>\n<p>You thought him intelligent and devout:</p>\n<p>That was your ancient practice of vow and virtue,</p>\n<p>Which I recollect as if just waking up.\u201d</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As the Brahmin Student Jotip\u0101la in the Time of Buddha Kassapa<b> </b><span id=\"Endnote21\">[<a href=\"#endnote21\">21</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Once, while traveling with a large Sa\u1e45gha in the Kosalan country, the Buddha smiled upon seeing a particular place off the main road.

Tath\u0101gatas do not smile for no reason.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>Approaching the Buddha, Venerable \u0100nanda inquired about the cause of his smile. The Blessed One then revealed that in a distant past, this very place had been a prosperous town called Vebhali\u1e45ga, where the monastery of the former Buddha Kassapa once stood. He recounted how a humble potter named Gha\u1e6d\u012bk\u0101ra, a devoted disciple of Buddha Kassapa, had inspired his close friend, the young brahmin student Jotip\u0101la, to visit the Enlightened One. Upon hearing the Dhamma, Jotip\u0101la became a disciple of the Buddha Kassapa. The Blessed One then declared:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cNow, \u0100nanda, you may think: \u2018Certainly, someone else was the brahmin student Jotip\u0101la on that occasion.\u2019 But it should not be regarded thus.

Before proceeding, the wise king consulted his chief minister and chaplain, the learned Purohita. With wisdom and discernment, the chaplain instructed the king on performing the sacrifice with sixteen noble requisites\u2014ensuring that it was conducted without the taking of life. Instead of bloodshed, the offering consisted of pure gifts: ghee, oil, butter, curds, honey, and molasses, symbolizing generosity and compassion.</p>\n<p>Deeply moved by the Blessed One\u2019s words, the Brahmin Kutadanta asked, \u201cVenerable Sir, in that past life, were you the king or the chaplain?\u201d</p>\n<p>The Blessed One replied with serene authority:</p>\n<p><b>\u201cIndeed, Brahmin, I was the Brahmin chaplain who guided that sacrifice.\u201d </b><i>\u2019</i><span id=\"Endnote24\">[<a href=\"#endnote24\">24</a>]</span><i> </i></p>\n<h2>King Mah\u0101sudassana, the Wheel-Turning Monarch of Kus\u0101vat\u012b</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>As the Blessed One lay in the s\u0101l-grove of the Mallas in Kusinara, approaching his final Nibb\u0101na, Venerable \u0100nanda, overcome with sorrow, respectfully implored him:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\u201cLord, may the Blessed One not pass away in this humble town of wattle-and-daub, deep in the jungle\u2026 There are great and illustrious cities\u2014Campa, R\u0101jagaha, S\u0101vatthi\u2014where devoted Khattiyas, Brahmins, and householders would honour the Tath\u0101gata\u2019s passing and provide for his funeral in a manner befitting his greatness.\u201d </i><span id=\"Endnote25\">[<a href=\"#endnote25\">25</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>With infinite wisdom and compassion, the Blessed One revealed the true nature of Kusinara.

He narrated the story of <b>King Pacetana</b> and his royal chariot maker:</p>\n<p>As the king prepared for an impending war, he commanded his chariot maker to craft a pair of wheels for his royal chariot. With great care and precision, the craftsman dedicated <b>six months</b> to forging a single wheel. When the king inspected his progress, he was surprised to find that only one wheel had been completed. Urging him to hasten the task, the king set a deadline\u2014he needed both wheels in just <b>six days</b>. The chariot maker complied and swiftly finished the second wheel within the given time.</p>\n<p>When the time came to test them, the king, unable to distinguish any difference in appearance, questioned the chariot maker. In response, the craftsman demonstrated their qualities. He took the wheel that was made in six days and set it rolling\u2014it went only a short distance before <b>wobbling and collapsing to the ground.</b> However, when he rolled the wheel that had been carefully crafted over six months, it <b>moved steadily, covering a great distance before coming to rest upright, firm upon its axle.</b></p>\n<p>Amazed, the king asked why the two wheels behaved so differently. The chariot maker explained:</p>\n<p><b>\u201c</b>Lord, the wheel that took six days to complete has a rim, spokes, and nave that are crooked, faulty, and poorly fitted. Thus, it rolled only as far as the momentum carried it before faltering and falling. But the wheel that took six months to craft was made with precision\u2014its rim, spokes, and nave are free from faults, well-balanced, and perfectly aligned. For this reason, it rolled steadily, as far as its momentum carried it, and came to rest upright as though fixed on an axle.\u201d</p>\n<p>Concluding the story, the Blessed One turned to the Sa\u1e45gha and revealed:</p>\n<p><b>\u201cMonks, in that past life, I was the royal chariot maker.\u201d</b></p>\n<p>With this parable, the Buddha imparted a profound lesson\u2014just as a poorly made wheel cannot stand firm, those who are <b>crooked in body, speech, and mind, neglecting the path, will falter and fall away from the Dhamma.</b> But those who <b>train with diligence, cultivate integrity, and perfect their practice,</b> like the well-crafted wheel, will stand unwavering in the Noble Dispensation, steadfast in the journey toward liberation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>King Makh\u0101deva of Mithil\u0101 and King Nimi<b> </b><span id=\"Endnote30\">[<a href=\"#endnote30\">30</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Once, while the Blessed One was residing in the Makh\u0101deva Mango Grove of Mithil\u0101, he smiled at a particular place. Seeing this, Venerable \u0100nanda, knowing that Tath\u0101gatas do not smile without reas<b>on</b>, respectfully inquired about the cause of his smile. In response, the Buddha recounted the story of King Makh\u0101deva, a ruler of Mithil\u0101 in times long past\u2014a king who upheld righteousness and observed the Uposatha day<b>s</b> with great devotion.</p>\n<p>During that era, lifespans were long, and King Makh\u0101deva ruled for many years. Yet, mindful of the inevitability of aging, he made a solemn vow. He instructed his royal barber:<span id=\"Endnote31\">[<a href=\"#endnote31\">31</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>\u201cWhen you see the first grey hair upon my head, inform me at once.\u201d</b></p>\n<p>In due course, the barber discovered a single strand of grey hair and reported it to the king. Recognizing this as a sign of impermanence, the king renounced his throne, entrusting the kingdom to his son. Before departing into the homeless life, he gave him this solemn instruction:</p>\n<p><i>\u201c\u2026Dear prince, when you too see grey hairs upon your head, do not delay. Carefully instruct your eldest son in kingship, then shave off your hair and beard, don the yellow robe, and go forth into the homeless life. Continue this noble tradition established by me\u2014do not be the last to uphold it.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>Thus, the tradition of renunciation established by the Bodhisatta as King Makh\u0101deva endured for generations. Successive kings, following his footsteps, relinquished their thrones upon the sight of grey hairs. The last in this noble lineage was <b>King Nimi</b>, who likewise renounced the world upon aging and embraced the ascetic life.</p>\n<p>However, his son, King Ka\u1e37\u0101rajanaka, broke the tradition. When old age approached, he clung to his throne, forsaking the path of renunciation. With this, the noble practice established by King Makh\u0101deva came to an end.</p>\n<p>Turning to Venerable \u0100nanda, the Blessed One revealed:</p>\n<p>\u201c\u0100nanda, you may think that King Makh\u0101deva of that time was someone other than me. But you should not see it so. I was King Makh\u0101deva on that occasion. It was I who instituted that noble tradition, and for many generations, it was upheld. Yet, \u0100nanda, that practice, though meritorious, did not lead to true liberation. It brought only rebirth in the Brahm\u0101-world.</p>\n<p>But now, \u0100nanda, I have established a far greater practice\u2014one that leads not to mere celestial rebirth, but to true disenchantment, to dispassion, to the complete cessation of suffering\u2014to Nibb\u0101na.</p>\n<p><b><i>Therefore, \u0100nanda, I say to you: Continue this noble practice I have now established.

Vel\u0101ma bestowed magnificent alms in nine diverse forms\u2014ranging from golden bowls to silver bowls\u2014with each type offered in the astonishing quantity of 84,000.</p>\n<p>Then the Buddha spoke:</p>\n<p>\u201cYou might be inclined, dear householder, to think, \u2018Those great alms offering was made by some other Brahmin Vel\u0101ma.\u2019 But understand this: I was that very Brahmin Vel\u0101ma.</p>\n<p><b>Yet, at those alms offering, there was not a single recipient truly worthy of the gift\u2014none who had purified their being.

Here are some treasured accounts:</p>\n<h2>Lives of Five Buddhas Who Appeared Before the Buddha Gotama</h2>\n<p>One day, the Bhikkhu Sa\u1e45gha, residing in An\u0101thapi\u1e47\u1e0dika\u2019s park in the serene Jeta Grove, gathered in the Dhamma hall after the meal to reflect on their former lives. As they engaged in this heartfelt discussion, the Blessed One approached them and gently inquired about their conversation. When the Sa\u1e45gha explained, he warmly asked if they would be willing to hear a discourse on past lives. With open hearts, they consented.<i> \u201d</i><span id=\"Endnote37\">[<a href=\"#endnote37\">37</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In his compassionate and clear manner, the Buddha then recounted a magnificent vision of time: over ninety-one aeons, seven fully enlightened Buddhas appeared in the world.</p>\n<h3>Appearance of the Seven Fully Enlightened Buddhas</h3>\n<p>The Blessed One explained that ninety-one aeons ago, <b>Buddha Vipass\u012b</b> arose; thirty-one aeons ago, <b>Buddha Sikhi</b> arose. Int the same thirty-first aeon before this <b>Buddha Vessabh\u016b</b> emerged. In the present fortune aeon, five Buddhas\u2014<b>Kakusandha, Konagamana, Kassapa,</b> and finally <b>Buddha Gotama</b>, the Blessed One himself\u2014manifested to guide all beings with their profound wisdom. The sutta even lovingly details the lives of these Buddhas\u2014their families, moments of enlightenment, and the names of their chief disciples.</p>\n<p>Overwhelmed by the depth of this revelation, the monks marvelled at the Tath\u0101gata\u2019s extraordinary psychic abilities. One of them expressed in awe:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cFriends, it is truly marvellous\u2014the Tath\u0101gata\u2019s immense power and insight. He recalls the past Buddhas who have attained Parinibb\u0101na\u2014their births, names, clans, lifespans, and the noble assemblies that accompanied them. But tell me, how did he come by such penetrative knowledge? Was it a deva who revealed these things to him?\u201d</i></p>\n<p>Later, having left his seclusion, the Buddha returned and kindly asked, \u201cWhat conversation did I interrupt as you sat together?\u201d When the monks shared their discussion, the Blessed One replied with gentle assurance:</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Tath\u0101gata understands these matters by his own deep penetration into the principles of the Dhamma; and indeed, the devas, too, have shared their wisdom with him.\u201d <span id=\"Endnote38\">[<a href=\"#endnote38\">38</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>The Tath\u0101gata\u2019s Penetration of the Past Buddhas</h3>\n<p>The Buddha elaborated thus:</p>\n<p>And so it is, monks, that through his profound penetration of the Dhamma\u2019s essence, the Tath\u0101gata recalls the past Buddhas\u2014those Fully Enlightened Ones who have attained final Nibb\u0101na. Having cut through the countless complexities of existence, they blazed the path of liberation, bringing an end to the cycle of birth and death. With perfect wisdom, they transcended all suffering and exhaustion, leaving behind only the pure radiance of their teachings.</p>\n<p>The Tath\u0101gata remembers them\u2014those Blessed Ones who came before\u2014recalling their births, their names, their noble clans.

As greed and neglect take root, poverty spreads, leading to theft, violence, and the decline of life itself. In a world consumed by wrongdoing, human lifespan dwindles, eventually reaching a mere ten years.

In each incarnation, the Blessed One exemplified the transformative power of virtuous actions, showing us that every step on the spiritual path brings us closer to liberation from the endless cycle of birth, sickness, death, and sorrow.</p>\n<p>The Buddha\u2019s teachings remind us that it is far better to choose the path that leads to the cessation of suffering than to remain entangled in sams\u0101ra. He encouraged us to see beyond the impermanence of this world and to embrace a life of mindful practice, cultivating insight, loving-kindness, and equanimity. Such a path, though challenging, offers us the ultimate freedom\u2014a life where the calamities of existence give way to the profound peace of Nibb\u0101na.</p>\n<p>This narrative reminds us that the journey of spiritual growth is built upon consistent, dedicated practice. Even in human life, where challenges abound, every mindful step and every act of virtue accumulates merit, paving the way for profound transformation. May these cherished narratives remind us of the wondrous and mysterious ways the Dhamma unfolds, guiding all beings ever closer to enlightenment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>May we sincerely wish that we all find strength in our journey towards peace; may we have courage and wisdom in every step! May we acquire endless nerite through our true generosity, kindness and our virtuous conduct!  Each step taken with love and awareness not only nurtures our inner growth but also radiates peace and compassion to all beings.</p>\n<p>Dear readers, let these past lives inspire you to persist with courage and compassion on your own journey. Every mindful act, every step taken with awareness and love, builds the merit and understanding needed to transcend the cycle of suffering. May the Buddha\u2019s timeless example guide you toward the radiant light of liberation, where the endless sorrows of sams\u0101ra finally come to an end, and you dwell in everlasting peace!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>With those words we would like to end this section.

We then traced the footsteps of the Buddha as he departed from the city, passing through the Royal Guest House at Ambala\u1e6d\u1e6dhik\u0101 and continuing onward to N\u0101\u1e37and\u0101. Having stayed in N\u0101\u1e37and\u0101 as long as he wished, the Blessed One said to the Venerable \u0100nanda, \u201cLet us go to P\u0101\u1e6dalig\u0101ma.\u201d\nAnd so they departed together with the Sa\u1e45gha.----endnote1----\n\n<h2>Arrival at P\u0101\u1e6dalig\u0101ma (Present-day Patna, Bihar)</h2>\nAt the time of the Buddha, P\u0101\u1e6dalig\u0101ma was not yet a major city, but it served as a significant river port within the Kingdom of Magadha. In later centuries, it grew in importance and became known as P\u0101\u1e6daliputta, the capital of Emperor Asoka\u2019s great empire. During the British colonial era, the area continued to flourish as a major trade centre.

Eager to welcome the Buddha and the monks, they prepared a rest house \u2014 cleaning it thoroughly and arranging all that was needed.\nAs evening approached, the villagers lit oil lamps, placed pots of water for foot-washing, and arranged suitable seats for the Blessed One and the Sa\u1e45gha. When everything was ready, they humbly invited the Buddha to enter and rest there. Out of compassion, the Blessed One accepted their invitation.\nSeated among the villagers, the Buddha addressed them with wisdom and care:\n\u201cHouseholders, there are these <b>five dangers for one who is immoral</b>, who fails in virtue.\n\n1)\t<i>He suffers great loss of property through neglect of his affairs.</i>\n\n2)\t<i>He gains a bad reputation for immoral and improper conduct.</i>\n\n3)\t<i>He becomes shy and fearful in any assembly \u2014 whether of Khattiyas, Brahmins, householders, or ascetics.</i>\n\n4)\t<i>He dies in confusion.</i>\n\n5)\t<i>After death, he is reborn in a woeful state, a bad destination, in suffering and hell.\u201d</i>\nThen the Blessed One continued:\n\u201cHouseholders, there are these <b>five benefits for one who is virtuo</b>us, who succeeds in morality.\n\n1)\t<i>By careful attention to his affairs, he gains great wealth.</i>\n\n2)\t<i>He earns a good reputation for moral and wholesome conduct.</i>\n\n3)\t<i>He approaches any assembly \u2014 whether of Khattiyas, Brahmins, householders, or ascetics \u2014 with confidence and ease.</i>\n\n4)\t<i>He dies unconfused, with peace of mind.</i>\n\n5)\t<i>After death, he is reborn in a happy destination, a heavenly realm.\u201d</i>\nThe Blessed One then instructed, inspired, and gladdened the lay-followers of P\u0101\u1e6dalig\u0101ma with profound Dhamma teachings, continuing far into the night. When it was late, he said:\n<i>\u201cHouseholders, the night is nearly over. Now it is time for you to do as you think fit.\u201d</i>\nFilled with joy and gratitude, the villagers paid homage to the Blessed One and the noble Sa\u1e45gha. Having seen the Buddha and listened to the sweet and profound Dhamma, their hearts were uplifted. With reverence, they quietly departed.\n\n\n\n\n\n----media/image3.jpeg----\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<b>Pataligama Villagers listening to the Buddha </b>----endnote4----\n\n<h3><b>The Buddha Foretells the Future of P\u0101\u1e6dalig\u0101ma</b></h3>\n\nAt the break of dawn on his first day in P\u0101\u1e6dalig\u0101ma, the Blessed One, with his divine eye that surpasses all human vision, beheld a wondrous sight: thousands of devas arriving to take residence in that town. Turning to the Venerable \u0100nanda, he asked:----endnote5----\n\n<i>\u201c\u0100nanda, who is building a fortress here at P\u0101\u1e6dalig\u0101ma?\u201d</i>\n\n\u0100nanda replied,\n\n<i>\u201cLord, it is Sunidha and Vassak\u0101ra, the Magadhan ministers. They are constructing a fortress as a defense against the Vajjians.\u201d</i>\n\nThen the Blessed One declared:\n\n\u201c\u0100nanda, it is as if Sunidha and Vassak\u0101ra had taken counsel with the Thirty-Three Gods themselves. \n\n\n\n\u201cFor I have seen with my divine eye how countless devas are settling here.\nKnow this, \u0100nanda: as far as the noble Ariyan realm stretches, as far as its trade and prosperity reach, this place will become the chief city\u2014P\u0101\u1e6daliputta\u2014spreading its influence far and wide.\nYet, \u0100nanda, P\u0101\u1e6daliputta will face three dangers: from fire, from water, and from internal strife.\u201d\n\n<h3>Alms Giving of Ministers Sunidha and Vassak\u0101ra</h3>\n\nLater, the ministers invited the Blessed One and the Sa\u1e45gha to their residence for the mid-day meal. They prepared a refined feast of both hard and soft foods, offered with heartfelt devotion. After the meal, the Blessed One expressed his gratitude through a radiant verse of <i>anumodan\u0101</i>\u2014rejoicing in their meritorious act:\n\n<i>\u201cIn whatever realm the wise make their home,</i>\n<i>Let them nourish those who live the holy life.</i>\n<i>The devas who witness such offerings will honour them in return,</i>\n<i>They will guard them as a mother guards her only child.</i>\n<i>And truly, the one whom the devas guard, lives in happiness.\u201d</i>\n\nThis was the last discourse given by the Blessed One in ancient P\u0101\u1e6dalig\u0101ma\u2014overflowing with compassion and guiding householders toward generosity, a virtue that brings happiness in this life and in lives yet to come.\n\nJoyfully moved by the Buddha\u2019s words, Sunidha and Vassak\u0101ra paid homage. When the Blessed One rose and prepared to depart, the ministers followed him, saying:\n\n<i>\u201cWhichever gate the ascetic Gotama departs through today, let it be known as the Gotama Gate (Gotamudv\u0101ra). And whichever ford he uses to cross the sacred Ganges, let it be called the Gotama Ford (Gotamatittha).\u201d</i>\n\n----Image alt text----&gt;Sabhyata Dwar in Gandhi Maidan,Patna - Tourist Attraction near me in Patna  - Justdial&lt;----media/image4.jpeg----\n\n\n\n<h3></h3>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3></h3>\n<b>Sabhyata Dwar in Patna- Gateway to the Ganges </b>----endnote6----\n\n<h3>A Note on P\u0101\u1e6dalig\u0101ma\u2019s Legacy</h3>\n\nToday, P\u0101\u1e6dalig\u0101ma is known as Patna, the capital of Bihar. While the exact locations of the ancient Gotama Gate and Gotama Ford have not been identified, the spirit of that sacred encounter lives on. Near the banks of the Ganga, Patna now features the <i>Sabhyata Dwar</i>\u2014the Civilization Gate\u2014a grand sandstone arch that echoes the city\u2019s ancient glory. Though not directly linked to the Buddha\u2019s visit, its Mauryan-inspired architecture stands as a reminder of the deep spiritual and cultural roots of this region.<b> </b>----endnote7----\n\n<h2>The Buddha and the Sangha Cross the Mighty River Ganges</h2>\nThe River Ganges, as it journeys through the northern plains of India, is joined by numerous tributaries and streams, gradually widening until, near present-day Patna, it stretches over four kilometres (2.5 miles) across. In modern times, bridges such as the Gandhi Setu (Ganga Setu) span this mighty river, linking the southern city of Patna to the northern region of Haripur in Bihar. This impressive structure, 4.56 km long, ----endnote8---- stands as one of the longest river bridges in India. But in the time of the Blessed One, there were no bridges\u2014only the flowing waters, ferries, and the compassion of boatmen.\nThroughout his long teaching mission, the Blessed One is said to have crossed the Ganges many times, each occasion filled with meaning and spiritual resonance.\n<b>The first crossing,</b> though unrecorded, likely took place when the young ascetic was making his way southward to R\u0101jagaha. It is possible he passed through P\u0101talig\u0101ma, a village that would one day become P\u0101\u1e6daliputta. With no money and newly embarked on his path of renunciation, the ascetic might have relied on the kindness of a humble boatman who, moved by compassion, ferried him across the river without charge. At this stage, he had not yet cultivated the meditative mastery to traverse the river through supernormal means.\nThe <b>second significant crossing came</b> soon after his enlightenment, as the Buddha journeyed with great compassion to the Deer Park at Isipatana to share the Dhamma with the five ascetics who had once supported him during his austere practices. Following the ancient route from Gaya to Varanasi, he approached the sacred city, which lies along the Ganges, a natural point of crossing. Tradition holds that a boatman refused to take him without payment, and since the Blessed One carried no possessions, the request could not be met. Yet he did not argue or demonstrate displeasure. Instead, he simply crossed the river through his supernormal power\u2014swiftly and serenely, not to impress or astonish, but as an expression of pure resolve and self-mastery. Witnessing this, the boatman was said to be so moved that he reported the event to the king, who then declared that all ascetics should henceforth be allowed to cross the river freely.  ----endnote9----\n\n----media/image5.png----\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<b>The Buddha Crossing the Ganges River near Varanasi </b>----endnote10----\n\n\n\n<b>In another instance</b>, recorded in section 14.3, we see how deep the reverence for the Buddha had grown. During a devastating epidemic in Ves\u0101l\u012b, the Buddha and the Sangha were invited by the Licchav\u012bs to bring solace to the city. King Bimbis\u0101ra, with great devotion, arranged for a royal barge to ferry them across the Ganges from P\u0101talig\u0101ma. He lovingly accompanied the Blessed One to the river\u2019s edge and waited in the barge until the Buddha and Sangha arrived. This episode reflects the honour and faith the people of the time placed in the Buddha, who had become a beacon of healing and wisdom in a suffering world.\nAnd yet, it is <b>the final crossing of the River Ganges</b>\u2014poignant and profound\u2014that remains etched in the heart of the Dhamma tradition. It took place during the Blessed One\u2019s last journey northward. By then, the rulers of Magadha, including King Aj\u0101tasattu and his ministers Sunidha and Vassak\u0101ra, resided at P\u0101talig\u0101ma. Yet no arrangements were made by them for the Blessed One\u2019s passage.\nHere is how the scriptures describe this moment:\n<i>\u201cAnd then the Lord came to the River Ganges. And just then, the river was so full that a crow could drink from it. And some people were looking for a boat, and some were looking for a raft, and some were binding together a raft of reeds to get to the other side. But the Lord, as swiftly as a strong man might stretch out his flexed arm or flex it again, vanished from this side of the Ganges and reappeared with his order of monks on the other shore.\u201d</i>\nObserving the people striving to cross\u2014gathering wood, weaving rafts, seeking boats\u2014the Buddha offered this verse on the spot:\n<i>\u201cWhen they want to cross the sea, the lake or pond,\nPeople make a bridge or raft \u2014 the wise have crossed already.\u201d</i>\nIn these few lines, the Blessed One encapsulated the essence of liberation. While others seek means to cross, the truly wise have already reached the far shore\u2014free, serene, and unhindered.\nThis final crossing of the Ganges was not merely a physical act; it was a symbol of the Buddha\u2019s journey beyond the world\u2019s tides. In silence, without fanfare, with only the Sangha by his side, he stepped across the river as if to remind us: the true path lies not in waiting for help, but in inner awakening.\n<h2>A Brief Stop at Ukkacel\u0101</h2>\nAfter crossing the Ganges River, the next logical stop on the Blessed One\u2019s final journey would have been Ukkacel\u0101\u2014the nearest crossing point on the northern bank of the river. As noted earlier (see Section 19-1):\n<i>\u201cFrom Chapra, the Blessed One and his Sangha may have journeyed eastward along the serene northern bank of the Ganges River, covering approximately 57 kilometres (about 4.6 yojanas). Eventually, they reached Ukkacel\u0101, an ancient locality within the territory of Ves\u0101l\u012b, now identified with modern-day Hajipur in the state of Bihar.\u201d</i>\n<h3>Final passing (parinibb\u0101na) of two chief disciples, Venerable S\u0101riputta and Venerable Mah\u0101 Moggall\u0101na.</h3>\nAlthough this stop is not explicitly mentioned in the <i>Mah\u0101parinibb\u0101na Sutta</i> (DN 16), we have chosen to include it here. Why? Because another important discourse\u2014the <i>Ukkacel\u0101 Sutta</i> (SN 47:14)\u2014records a deeply moving moment that occurred in this very location: the Blessed One\u2019s public acknowledgment of the final passing (parinibb\u0101na) of his two chief disciples, Venerable S\u0101riputta and Venerable Mah\u0101 Moggall\u0101na. We offer this episode not to dispute the canonical sequence, but in humility and faith, to fill a contemplative gap in the final journey narrative.\nAs earlier noted, the Buddha undertook his last journey accompanied by many noble disciples. The <i>Mah\u0101parinibb\u0101na Sutta</i> mentions some of them by name\u2014such as Venerables S\u0101riputta (whose meeting with the Buddha is described in Section 19-2), \u0100nanda, Anuruddha, Cunda (the novice and younger brother of S\u0101riputta), and Upav\u0101na. The name of Mah\u0101 Moggall\u0101na is not mentioned in DN 16. However, based on the <i>Ukkacel\u0101 Sutta</i> (SN 47:14), we infer that he too was part of this final tour, as the discourse places the Buddha at Ukkacel\u0101 shortly after the parinibb\u0101na of both S\u0101riputta and Moggall\u0101na.\nAccording to the Ukkacel\u0101 Sutta: (SN47:14)\n\u201cOn one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Vajjians at Ukkacel\u0101 on the bank of the Ganges, together with a great Bhikkhu Sa\u1e45gha, not long after S\u0101riputta and Moggall\u0101na had attained final Nibb\u0101na. The Blessed One, surveying the silent Sa\u1e45gha, addressed the monks:\n\u2018<i>Bhikkhus, this assembly appears to me empty now that S\u0101riputta and Moggall\u0101na have attained final Nibb\u0101na. Earlier, this assembly was not empty for me. I had no concern for whatever quarter S\u0101riputta and Moggall\u0101na were dwelling in.\u2019</i>\nHe then declared with deep equanimity that even the most outstanding disciples are subject to impermanence. Their passing, he said, was like the breaking off of the largest branches from a great tree\u2014yet he felt no sorrow, for such is the nature of all conditioned things.\nThe Blessed One then gave this enduring instruction:\n\u201c<i>Therefore, bhikkhus, dwell with yourselves as your own island, with yourselves as your own refuge\u2014with no other refuge. Dwell with the Dhamma as your island, with the Dhamma as your refuge\u2014with no other refuge.\u201d</i>\nThis powerful teaching reminds us of the centrality of self-reliance and mindfulness of the Dhamma, especially during times of loss.\n<h3>On the Chronology: A Note of Clarification</h3>\nThere is a small textual difficulty regarding the timeline of Venerable S\u0101riputta\u2019s passing. According to <i>Cunda Sutta</i> (SN 47:13), S\u0101riputta passed away in N\u0101lakag\u0101ma in Magadha. Novice Cunda then brought his bowl and robe to S\u0101vatth\u012b, where the Buddha was residing in Jeta\u2019s Grove. This seems to contradict the <i>Mah\u0101parinibb\u0101na Sutta</i>, which narrates the final journey from R\u0101jagaha to Kusin\u0101r\u0101, passing through Ves\u0101l\u012b but not returning to S\u0101vatth\u012b.\n<h3>Bhikkhu Bodhi observes:</h3>\n\u201cTo preserve the traditional chronology, the commentaries suggest that the Buddha made a side trip to S\u0101vatth\u012b following his rains retreat at Beluva (see DN II 98\u201399). S\u0101riputta accompanied him on this trip, and later took leave to return to his native village N\u0101lakag\u0101ma, where he passed away.\u201d (See: SN : Note:157)\nThis explanation, while not found in the suttas themselves, offers a respectful harmonization of the available sources and is rooted in the faith that has preserved these accounts through generations.\nIn recalling the stop at Ukkacel\u0101, we honour the lives and legacies of the two foremost disciples\u2014S\u0101riputta and Moggall\u0101na\u2014whose wisdom and spiritual strength upheld the Dhamma in their own time, and whose memory continues to inspire those who walk the Noble Path.----endnote11----\n\n\n\n\n\n----media/image6.jpeg----\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<b>The Buddha with his two chief disciples: Venerables S\u0101riputta and Moggall\u0101na </b>----endnote12----\n\n\n\n<h2>A Meaningful Pause at Ko\u1e6dig\u0101ma:A village by the north bank of the Ganges</h2>\nContinuing the Blessed One\u2019s final journey along the northern bank of the Ganges, we next arrive at Ko\u1e6dig\u0101ma, a quiet village steeped in spiritual significance. As recorded in the <i>Mah\u0101parinibb\u0101na Sutta</i> (DN 16), the Buddha said to Venerable \u0100nanda:\n<i>\u201cLet us go to Ko\u1e6dig\u0101ma.\u201d\n</i>\nAnd thus, with a large Sa\u1e45gha of monks, the Blessed One proceeded to Ko\u1e6dig\u0101ma and stayed there.\nIn <i>Section 19-2</i>, we examined several maps illustrating the final footsteps of the Buddha. Among them is a carefully researched map titled <i>Tath\u0101gatassa Pacchim\u0101 C\u0101rik\u0101 \u2014 The Realised One\u2019s Last Tour</i> by the respected Buddhist scholar Bhikkhu \u0100nandajoti. ----endnote13---- In this map, Ko\u1e6dig\u0101ma is placed near present-day Hajipur, Bihar \u2014 situated on the north bank of the Ganges. Interestingly, this is also the region associated with Ukkacel\u0101, which we encountered just before. In modern maps of Bihar, ancient villages like Ukkacel\u0101 and Ko\u1e6dig\u0101ma may no longer appear, but tradition places Ko\u1e6dig\u0101ma on the ancient path leading toward Ves\u0101li (Vaishali), approximately 18 km away. (see the Google map given below).\n\n\n\n----media/image7.png----\n\n<h3>The Buddha\u2019s Profound Teaching at Ko\u1e6dig\u0101ma</h3>\nWhile dwelling in Ko\u1e6dig\u0101ma, the Blessed One, ever-compassionate and mindful of his disciples\u2019 welfare, offered a profound teaching. He reminded the community of monks about the Four Noble Truths, which lie at the heart of liberation. With deep concern for the spiritual progress of the Sa\u1e45gha, the Buddha declared:\n<i>\u201cMonks, it is through not understanding, not penetrating </i><b><i>the Four Noble Truths </i></b><i>that I\u2014as well as you\u2014have for a long time wandered on, caught in the cycle of birth and death.\u201d</i>\nHe went on to describe these Four Noble Truths once again:\n\n--\tThe Truth of Suffering\n\n--\tThe Truth of the Origin of Suffering\n\n--\tThe Truth of the Cessation of Suffering\n\n--\tThe Truth of the Path leading to the Cessation of Suffering\nBy fully understanding these truths, the Buddha said, the root of craving is severed, the fuel for rebirth is exhausted, and the round of sa\u1e41s\u0101ra comes to an end.\nThe Blessed One then recited a verse, radiant with insight:\n<i>\u201cNot seeing the Four Noble Truths as they are,\nHaving long traversed the round from life to life,\nThese being seen, becoming\u2019s supports pulled up,\nSorrow\u2019s root cut off, rebirth is done</i>.\u201d----endnote14----\n\n<h3>A Reminder: Morality, Samadhi, and Wisdom</h3>\nAt Ko\u1e6dig\u0101ma, the Buddha also emphasized the essential foundation of the path:\nS\u012bla (morality), Sam\u0101dhi , and Pa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101 (wisdom). These three serve as the pillars for abandoning unwholesome actions and cultivating wholesome ones\u2014by body, speech, and mind. Practised with mindfulness and wise attention (<i>yoniso manasik\u0101ra</i>), they lead to the development of liberating insight.\nWith this, the Blessed One continued preparing his disciples for the time when he would no longer be with them<b> in person\u2014but where the Dhamma and Vinaya would remain as their guiding light.</b>\n<h2>N\u0101dik\u0101\u2014A Village of Realised Devotees</h2>\nResuming the northbound journey, the Blessed One, accompanied by the Sangha, departed from Ko\u1e6dig\u0101ma\u2014the serene village nestled along the banks of the sacred Ganges\u2014and made his way to the ancient village of N\u0101dik\u0101, situated on the road to Ves\u0101l\u012b. Though absent from the modern-day maps of Bihar, the N\u0101dik\u0101 of the scriptures was clearly a place embraced by nature and sanctified by spiritual presence.\nThe texts tell us that the Buddha stayed there at the Brick House\u2014a rare structure in a village where most dwellings were made of wood. Its very name highlighted its distinctiveness and perhaps its symbolic strength, standing firm amidst a forested landscape.\n<i>\u201cThe Lord went with a large company of monks to N\u0101dik\u0101, where he stayed at the Brick House; it says most buildings being of wood, this was exceptional, hence its name.\u201d</i>----endnote15----\n\n\n\nBut it was not only the natural surroundings that gave N\u0101dik\u0101 its noble character. According to the scriptures, it was home to many lay men and women who ardently and faithfully followed the Dhamma. Even those who had passed away were remembered for their deep realisation\u2014many having attained rebirths in celestial realms, and some, having broken free from the wheel of existence entirely, had realised arahantship.\nWhile the Blessed One was residing in this sacred village, the Venerable \u0100nanda approached him and humbly inquired about the destinies of those who had passed away. With boundless compassion, the Buddha listed the names of the departed villagers and declared their spiritual attainments\u2014ranging from stream-entry to full liberation. He then concluded with an astonishing revelation:\n<i>\u201cWell over five hundred, by the destruction of three fetters, are Stream-Winners\u2014incapable of falling into states of woe, and certain of attaining Nibb\u0101na.\u201d</i>\nSuch a statement illumines N\u0101dik\u0101 as more than a village\u2014it was a sanctuary of profound realisation, a field of merit nurtured by the presence of the Tath\u0101gata.\nYet, in his gentle and insightful manner, the Buddha used this moment to offer a deeper teaching to \u0100nanda. With characteristic grace, he reminded:\n\u201c<i>\u0100nanda, it is not remarkable that that which has come to be as a man should die. But that you should come to the Tath\u0101gata to ask the fate of each of those who have died, that is a weariness to him\u2026\u201d</i>\n<h3>Mirror of the Dhammma</h3>\nInstead, the Blessed One offered the Mirror of the Dhamma\u2014a luminous method for self-realisation, where one need not inquire of others but reflect within and know with confidence the path one is on.\n<i>\u201cTherefore, \u0100nanda, I will teach you a way of knowing Dhamma, called the Mirror of Dhamma, whereby the Ariyan disciple, if he so wishes, can discern of himself:\n\u2018I have destroyed hell, animal-rebirth, the realm of ghosts, all downfall, evil fates and sorry states. I am a Stream-Winner, incapable of falling into states of woe, certain of attaining Nibb\u0101na.\u2019\u201d</i>\nAnd what is this Mirror of Dhamma?\nIt is the possession of unwavering confidence\u2014in the Buddha, in the Dhamma, and in the Sangha. When such faith is deeply rooted, the disciple sees the path clearly and walks it with certainty, secure in the knowledge that liberation is assured.\n<h2>Revisiting Ves\u0101l\u012b \u2013 The Glorious Capital of the Licchavis</h2>\nThe Mah\u0101parinibb\u0101na sutta tell us:\n<i>\u201cAnd when the Blessed One had stayed at N\u0101dik\u0101 as long as he wished, he departed with a large company of monks and journeyed to Ves\u0101l\u012b, where he stayed in Ambap\u0101l\u012b\u2019s Mango Grove.\u201d</i>\nWith these words, we are transported to the ancient city of Ves\u0101l\u012b\u2014once the vibrant capital of the Licchavis, nestled in what is today Bihar, India. Ves\u0101l\u012b was not only a cradle of republican ideals\u2014home to one of the earliest known forms of democratic governance\u2014but also a city that shone in the light of the Dhamma. It was here that the Buddha delivered teachings of timeless relevance, leaving behind traces of his boundless compassion and insight. Earlier, the Buddha had praised the Vajjian people, encouraging them to uphold \n<i>\u201c</i><b><i>The Seven Principles of Non-Decline</i></b><i>\u201d</i>, ensuring their prosperity and longevity. He declared:\n<i>\u201cAs long as the Vajjians uphold these principles, they may be expected to prosper and not decline.\u201d</i> (DN 16 and Section 19-2)\nThese principles emphasized unity, frequent assemblies, respect for tradition, protection of the vulnerable, and spiritual reverence\u2014guidelines for noble governance deeply rooted in moral discipline and collective harmony.\n\n\n\n----Image alt text----&gt;undefined&lt;----media/image8.jpeg----\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<b>Modern day stupa in Vaisali </b>----endnote16----\n\n----media/image9.jpeg----\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h3></h3>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3></h3>\n<b>Ruins of Vaisali- the Ashokan Pillar, Stupa and Ramkund Tank</b>----endnote17----<b>\n</b>\n<h3>The Sacred Sites of Ves\u0101l\u012b</h3>\nThe Buddha's visits to Ves\u0101l\u012b were marked by his stays at various significant places\u2014most notably the <i>K\u016b\u1e6d\u0101g\u0101ras\u0101l\u0101</i> or \"Peak-roofed Hall\" in the <i>Mah\u0101vana</i> (Great Wood). Other venerated shrines mentioned in the suttas include the Udena, Gotamaka, Sattambaka, Bahuputta, S\u0101randada, and C\u0101p\u0101la shrines\u2014each echoing the footsteps of the Tath\u0101gata and the early Sangha, each sanctified by his presence.----endnote18----\n\n\n\n<h3>The Beautiful Courtesan: Ambap\u0101l\u012b\u2019s Transformation</h3>\nAmong the cherished stories of Ves\u0101l\u012b is that of Ambap\u0101l\u012b, the renowned courtesan whose name still resounds with reverence. ----endnote19---- Appointed by the king and beloved by the people for her beauty and grace, Ambap\u0101l\u012b\u2019s life took a profound turn upon encountering the Buddha.\nHearing that the Blessed One had arrived at Ko\u1e6dig\u0101ma, she journeyed with her magnificent retinue in splendid chariots to meet him. After listening to his discourse, her heart was moved with deep faith. She immediately invited the Buddha and the Sangha for a meal the following day\u2014a gesture so earnest that she refused to yield even to the Licchavi princes who sought the same honour. Her devotion triumphed over worldly prestige. <i>.\u201d</i>----endnote20----\n\nAfter offering the meal, she made a magnificent gift\u2014the donation of her mango grove, <i>Ambap\u0101livana</i>, to the Buddha and his monastic order. It was a place of rest, reflection, and retreat for the Sangha, and there, the Blessed One gave teachings of great depth.\nBut Ambap\u0101l\u012b\u2019s journey did not end with generosity alone. Renouncing the fleeting pleasures of sensual life, later she ordained as a bhikkhun\u012b and\u2014through deep insight and perseverance\u2014attained Arahantship. Her verses in the <i>Ther\u012bg\u0101th\u0101</i> still resonate with profound clarity:\n<i>\u201cMy body once radiant like a golden image,</i>\n<i>now withered, marked by time\u2014</i>\n<i>as the Truthful One declared it would be.\u201d</i>\n<i>\u201cThis bag of bones once adorned with beauty,</i>\n<i>now a dwelling of decay and pain.</i>\n<i>Just as a house falls to ruin,</i>\n<i>so too does the body\u2014</i>\n<i>and in this I see the truth.\u201d </i>----endnote21----\n\nHer transformation\u2014from the celebrated courtesan of Ves\u0101l\u012b to a liberated Arahant\u2014stands as a shining testimony to the power of the Dhamma to awaken, uplift, and free.\n\n\n\n----media/image10.png----\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<b>The body outside used to be so pretty, but it is nothing else just a bag of bones, realizing the truth uttered by the Blessed One, seen the reality of life beautiful Ambapali </b>\n<b>became a renowned Arahant Bhikkhuni</b>----endnote22----\n\n<h3>A Timely Teaching at the Mango Grove</h3>\nWhile residing in Ambap\u0101l\u012b\u2019s grove, the Buddha gave the Sangha a profound and timely admonition\u2014a safeguard for those still walking the path:\n<i>\u201cMonks, a monk should be mindful and clearly aware\u2014this is our charge to you.\u201d</i>\nHe detailed the cultivation of sati (mindfulness) and sampaja\u00f1\u00f1a (clear comprehension) in every action: walking, sitting, eating, dressing, speaking, even in silence. The instruction was not merely technical; it was a compassionate forewarning. The next day, the Sangha would be welcomed into the home of a woman once famed for her charm and allure. The Buddha, with his infinite wisdom, anticipated the inner challenges some monks might face and offered this teaching as a shield\u2014a way to guard the mind through awareness.\nIndeed, in earlier instances too, we hear of monks swayed by worldly beauty, such as in the story of Sirim\u0101 (see section 16-2) The Buddha\u2019s teachings were thus not abstract ideals but a living, responsive guidance shaped with compassion and foresight for his disciples\u2019 welfare.\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\nTo revisit Ves\u0101l\u012b is to return to a place of luminous history, where the winds still whisper tales of spiritual triumph and transformation. It is a city that welcomed the Buddha with joy, where courtesans became saints, and where the Dhamma took deep root among rulers and citizens alike. Let us contemplate its stories not as distant echoes of the past, but as living inspirations for our own path\u2014reminders that no matter one\u2019s station, beauty, or wealth, liberation lies within reach of a heart turned toward the truth.\nWith that inspiring words we will end this section. The next section 19-4 will focus the Buddha spending his last rain retreat in a small village of Beluwa in Vajji country.\n<h3>End Notes: Section 19-3</h3>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nendnote1)\t DN:16\n\nendnote2)\t Source: https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/art-artists/work-of-art/part-of-the-city-of-patna-on-the-river-ganges\n\nendnote3)\t Source: https://www.holidify.com/places/patna/river-ganga-sightseeing-3224.html\n\nendnote4)\t Source: https://southeastasianlibrarygroup.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/or_5757_f023r1.jpg\n\nendnote5)\t DN:16\n\nendnote6)\t Source: https://www.justdial.com/Patna/Sabhyata-Dwar-Bankipur-Gandhi-Maidan/0612PX612-X612-220125233757-C1L8_BZDET\n\nendnote7)\t Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabhyata_Dwar.\n\nendnote8)\t Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridges_in_Bihar\n\nendnote9)\t It says that this incident is recorded in  Lalitavistara S\u016btra. * The Lalitavistara S\u016btra is a Sanskrit Mahayana Buddhist sutra that tells the story of Gautama Buddha from the time of his descent from Tushita until his first sermon in the Deer Park at Sarnath near Varanasi, source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lalitavistara_S%C5%ABtra\n\nendnote10)\t Source: https://www.superstock.com/asset/siddhartha-gautama-known-buddha-enlightened-one-he-crosses-ganges-river/4220-21848595\n\nendnote11)\t The commentaries assign the death of Moggall\u0101na to a fortnight after that of S\u0101riputta.
