By this time the five group of ascetics who were attending to the bodhisatta were not happy about his new mode of practice, left him and went to the Deer Park at Isipatana ----endnote3----. The Bodhisatta stayed in the River Bank of Neranjana, in solitude and resolute, determined to strive for enlightenment! In the following sutta we can see how he defeated Mara and realized the noble state called \u2018superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones\u2019 (<i>alm-ariya nanadassana </i><i>vesesana</i>) ----endnote4----\n\n\t\n\n\t\u2666 <b>Five Great Dreams</b>\n\nIn the following sutta the Buddha described the five dreams appeared to him before his enlightenment thus:\n\n\t\u201c<i>Bhikkhus, before his enlightenment, while he was just a bodhisatta, not fully enlightened, five great dreams appeared to the Tath\u0101gata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One. What five?\u201d</i>\n\n1) he dreamt that this mighty earth was his bedstead; the Him\u0101laya, king of mountains, was his pillow; his left hand rested on the eastern sea, his right hand on the western sea, and his two feet on the southern sea\u2014the dream, represented his awakening to the unsurpassed, perfect enlightenment.\n\n2) he dreamt that a grass called <i>tiriy\u0101 </i>rose up from his navel and stood touching the sky \u2014the dream showing that he would awaken to the noble eightfold path and would proclaim it well among devas and humans.\n\n3) he dreamt that white worms with black heads crawled from his feet up to his knees and covered them\u2014the dream showing that many lay followers would follow his teachings.\n\n4) he dreamt that four birds of different colours came from the four quarters, fell at his feet, and turned all white\u2014the dream showing that members of the four classes\u2014\n\nkhattiyas, brahmins, vessas, and suddas\u2014would go forth from the household life into homelessness and become his disciples. \n\n5) he dreamt that he climbed up a huge mountain of dung without being soiled by it\u2014the dream showing that he would receive the four requisites to sustain the homeless life  and he would use them without being tied to them, infatuated with them, and blindly absorbed in them, seeing the danger and knowing the escape ----endnote5----.\n\n<b>Note: </b>These dreams are like foretoken (pubbanimitta) indication that the bodhisatta would gain the Buddhahood in the near future.\n<b>\u2666 </b><b>Encounters with M\u0101ra </b>----endnote6----\n\nOn the occasion when the bodhisattva was sitting in meditation under the <i>assattha</i> bo-tree ----endnote7----, in the bank of Neranjana river, M\u0101ra wanted to discourage bodhisattva from attending liberation, wanted to hold him in his grip. Below we can see a passage from Suttanipata, how the M\u0101ra, was trying to persuade the Bodisatta away from Buddhahood. \n\nThe Buddha elaborates this event thus:\n\n\u201cAs I strove to subdue myself\nbeside the broad Nera\u00f1jar\u0101,\nabsorbed unflinchingly to gain\nthe surcease of bondage here,\nNamuc\u012b came and spoke to me\nwith words all garbed in pity thus:\n\n<b>M\u0101ra</b>\n\n\u2018\u2026you are thin and you are pale,\nand you are in death\u2019s presence too:\n\na thousand parts are pledged to death\nbut life still holds one part of you.\nLive, sir! Life\u2019s the better way;\nyou may gain merit if you live,\n\ncome live the life of purity, pour\nlibations on the holy fires\nand thus a world of merit gain.\nWhat can you do by struggling now?\n\nThe path of struggling too is rough,\nand difficult and hard to bear\u2026\u2019\n\n\n\n<b>The Bodhisatta replied</b>: \n\nO Evil One, O Cousin of the Negligent, \n\nyou have come here for your own ends. \n\nNow, merit I need not at all. \nLet M\u0101ra talk of merit then,\nto those that stand in need of it.\n\nFor I have faith and energy,\nand I have understanding, too.\nSo while I thus subdue myself,\nwhy do you speak to me of life?\n\nThere is this wind that blows, can dry\neven the rivers\u2019 running streams;\nso while I thus subdue myself,\nwhy should it not dry up my blood?\n\nAnd, as the blood dries up, then bile\nand phlegm run dry, the wasting flesh\nbecalms the mind: I shall have more\nof mindfulness and wisdom too,\nI shall have greater concentration.\n\nFor living thus, I come to know\nthe limits to which feeling goes.\nMy mind looks not to sense-desires:\nNow see a being\u2019s purity\u2026\u201d ----endnote8----\n\n\n\nHaving understood the unshakeable determination of the bodhisattva, and that he has no power to defeat him, with a heavy heart M\u0101ra went away. \n\n<b>Note: * </b>The Dhamma message presented here is that unwavering effort is essential to tread on the spiritual path. The Right Effort (samma vayama), as outlined in the Eightfold Noble Truths, is vital for spiritual growth: right effort to eliminate existing evils, to prevent existing evils from arising, to enhance the existing merits, and to continue to acquire new merits. This is one of the essential factors-helping hand to achieve the goal. \n* Tradition says that in the morning of the day of enlightenment the bodhisatta partook milk rice offered by a maiden named Sujata, daughter of householder of nearby Senani village. Though the scriptures have no record of this event we can see a reference to her in the AN1: 258, the Blessed One declaring: <i>\u201c\u2026</i><b><i>the foremost of my female lay followers in being the first to go for refuge is Suj\u0101t\u0101</i></b><i>, daughter of Sen\u0101n\u012b</i>\u201d. (She offered the bodhisatta his last meal before his enlightenment see: AN: Notes: 139). ----endnote9----. In  Mahaparinibbana sutta (DN:16)there is a statement about alms offering to the Buddha:\n<i>\u201c\u2026</i><b><i>that these two alms-givings\u2019</i></b><i> are of very great fruit, of very great result, more fruitful and advantageous than any other. Which two? The one is the alms-giving after eating which the Tath\u0101gata attains supreme enlightenment, the other that after which he attains the Nibbana-element without remainder at his final passing\u201d.</i> As we know from the sutta that Cunda offered the last meal. It is not mentioned here that who had offered the first meal? If we go by legend, we can assume that Sujata offered the meal to the Buddha to be before his supreme enlightenment! \nIf we ponder little further about the Buddha \u2018s statement regarding Sujata being the foremost lay woman to go for refuge to him, we may see her as the fist woman who paid homage to the Buddha after his enlightenment? AN1 (XIV Foremost Chapter) all the others described there were persons who have gone to the refuge of the Buddha after his enlightenment. In the case of Thapassu and Ballika two brothers mentioned in AN1:248. thus: \u201c<i>Bhikkhus, the foremost of my male lay followers in being the first to go for refuge are the merchants Tapussa and Bhallika\u201d. </i>According to Vinaya Pitaka :\u201c\u2026<i>When Tapussa and Bhallika knew that the Buddha had finished his meal, they bowed down with their head at his feet, and said, \u201cSir, we go for refuge to the Buddha and the Teaching. Please accept us as lay followers who have gone for refuge for life.\u201d By means of the double refuge, they became the first lay followers in the world\u201d.</i> ----endnote10---- Hence, whether Sujata was paying respect to the bodhisatta and offered him his last meal or she was bowing down to the newly enlightened Buddha and offered him the first meal is uncertain. \n<b>\u25b2 Supreme Enlightenment -Samma Sam Bodhi</b>\n\nThe Bodhisattvas, with a strong determination to attain liberation, increased his velour; through his effort and unwavering heedfulness, he strove and won the battle with M\u0101ra and his tenfold army, and attained the supreme enlightenment. ----endnote11----\n\n\n\n\u2666 <b>The Blessed One describes his effort and determination as thus:</b>\n<i>\u201c\u2026bhikkhus, \u2026I strove indefatigably\u2026 \u2018willingly, let only my skin, sinews, and bones remain, and let the flesh and blood dry up in my body, but I will not relax my energy so long as I have not attained what can be attained by manly strength, energy, and exertion.\u2019 It was by heedfulness that I achieved enlightenment, bhikkhus; it was by heedfulness that I achieved the unsurpassed security from bondage\u2026\u201d. </i>----endnote12----\n\n\n\n<b>\u201c\u2026being myself subject to birth\u2026 ageing\u2026 sickness \u2026 death\u2026sorrow\u2026and defilements\u2026I attained the supreme security from bondage, Nibb\u0101na.

(see: SN: Note: 265).\n\n\t\n\n\t<b>\u25b2 What is Full Enlightenment? \u2013 Definition of Samma Sambuddha</b>\n\n\tSamma Sam Buddha is one of the nine noble qualities attributed to Tath\u0101gata. The nine qualities are: \n\n\t\n\n\t<i>\u201c\u2026the Blessed One is an arahant, perfectly enlightened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, fortunate, knower of the world, unsurpassed trainer of persons to be tamed, teacher of devas and humans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One.\u2019</i>----endnote16----\n\n\t \n\n\tWhen we see all the nine noble qualities attributed to the Blessed One, we could include all of them in to one term\u2014The Fully Enlightened One (Samma Sam Buddha). We can justify that claim by looking into noble nine qualities mentioned above:----endnote17----  \n\n\t\n\n\t1)  <b>Arahant\u2014</b>accomplished: Arahant: he has been freed from all the defilements of the worldly life; broken the cycle of samsara; abolished rebirth; and worthy of worship and respect from gods and humans----endnote18----\n\n\t2) <b>Samma Sam Buddha</b>\u2014 The Fully Enlightened One: he has discovered (buddha) all things rightly ( samm\u0101) and by himself (s\u0101mam), he fully understood the Four Noble Truths; he awakened from the great sleep of delusion; he attained the knowledge of omniscience.\n3)  <b>Vijj\u0101cara\u0146a sampanno</b> -Endowed with clear vision and virtuous conduct: \nThe scriptures mentioned three kinds of clear vision (knowledges) (<i>te-Vijja</i>\u2014Three knowledges) and also eight kinds of knowledges: <b>Three Knowledges</b>: 1. knowledge of the recollection of past lives (<i>pubbe-niv\u0101s\u0101ussati \u00f1\u0101\u0146a</i>) 2. knowledge of the passing away and reappearance of beings (<i>dibba-cakkhu</i>) 3.  knowledge of destruction of all taints ( <i>\u0101savakkhaya \u00f1\u0101\u0146a</i>) ----endnote19----\n\n\t <b>Eight kinds of knowledges\u2014</b>1-3 as mentioned above, 4.

The four jh\u0101nas  ----endnote21----\n\n<b>Note: </b>The Buddha after describing the knowledge and conduct of noble ones said: <i>\u201c\u2026and beyond this there is no further development of knowledge and conduct that is higher or more perfect\u2026\u201d: DN:4</i>.\n4) <b> Sugata-</b> Sublime: Because he has reached Nibbana through the path of the Arahant, and has been practicing the principles of the Ariya path since his Bodhisattva days, because he has a beautiful form, because he has a beautiful journey, because he has entered the beautiful place of Nibbana, and because he preaches the Dhamma in the voice of Brahma, he is called sublime one-Sugatha ----endnote22----\n\n5)<b>Lokavidu</b>- Knower of the world: he knows the three worlds fully, has seen the world fully, knows the extent of the world, knows how to end the world.\n6) <b>Anuttaro purisadammasarathi</b> -Incomparable leader of men to be tamed: he surpasses the whole world with his noble qualities hence there is no one to compare him (only equal to a another Samma Sam Buddha), he tames men to be tamed with great compassion and highest wisdom.\n7) <b>Sattha deva manussa-</b> Teacher of gods and men: Like the caravan teacher he guides beings across the wildness of samsara safely.\n8)<b> Buddha</b>-Enlightened: he knows the fruit of liberation, awakened from the delusion of the world. \n<b>Note</b>: In the following sutta Buddha elaborate this title:\n<i>What must be known is directly known, </i>\n<i>What must be developed has been developed, </i>\n<i>What must be abandoned has been abandoned, </i>\n<i>Therefore, brahmin, I am a Buddha.</i>\n<i>\u2018\u2018Abhi\u00f1\u00f1eyya\u1e43 abhi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101ta\u1e43, </i>\n<i>bh\u0101vetabba\u00f1ca bh\u0101vita\u1e43; </i>\n<i>Pah\u0101tabba\u1e43 pah\u012bna\u1e43 me, </i>\n<i>tasm\u0101 buddhosmi br\u0101hma\u1e47a </i>MN:92.\n* In the following sutta also we can see why a Fully Enlightened Being is called the Buddha:\n\u201cAs a lovely white lotus\nis not soiled by the water,\nI am not soiled by the world:\ntherefore, O brahmin, I am a Buddha.\u201d\nAN:4:36 (Dona sutta)\n9) <b>Bhagava-</b> Blessed: it is the best of the words, finest word, term for veneration and respect, fortunate one, liberated one, developed one.\n\n\t\n\n\tGoing through all those noble qualities we could see that Samma Sam Buddha carry all those traits within him.  In the following sutta we can get a glimpse of what is a Fully Enlightened One! \n\n\t\n\n\tThe Buddha said:\n\n\t<i>I am the one whose presence in the world </i>\n<i>Is very rarely come upon, </i>\n<i>I am the Fully Enlightened One, I, </i>\n<i>O brahmin, am the supreme physician.</i>\n<i>\u2018\u2018Yesa\u1e43 ve dullabho loke,</i>\n<i> p\u0101tubh\u0101vo abhi\u1e47haso; </i>\n<i>Soha\u1e43 br\u0101hma\u1e47a sambuddho, </i>\n<i>sallakatto anuttaro.</i>\n<i>I am supreme king of the Dhamma; </i>\n<i>By means of the Dhamma I turn the wheel, </i>\n<i>The wheel that none can stop.</i>\n<i>\u2018\u2018R\u0101j\u0101hamasmi sel\u0101ti, </i>\n<i>dhammar\u0101j\u0101 anuttaro; </i>\n<i>Dhammena cakka\u1e43 vattemi, </i>\n<i>cakka\u1e43 appa\u1e6divattiya\u1e43\u2019\u2019.</i>\nMN: 95. \n\n\t\n\n\tThe Buddha is the noble one who himself discovered the path to enlightenment. He has no teacher, he declares that path for the happiness of all the beings. From the following statement by Venerable \u0100nanda confirmed this: \n\n\t\n\n<i>\u201c\u2026the Blessed One, accomplished and fully enlightened. For the Blessed One was the arouser of the unarisen path, the producer of the unproduced path, the declarer of the undeclared path; he was the knower of the path, the finder of the path, the one skilled in the path\u2026\u201d.</i>\n\nMN:108\n\n\t\n\n\tWith all the testimony stated above, we can confirm that the presence of a Samma Sam Buddha in the world is extraordinary thing! A significant thing!  <b>Why is that?</b>\n\n\tAppearance of a Buddha in a world is amazing and very rare thing. According to Mah\u00e2pad\u0101na Sutta (DN:14) during the last \u2018ninety-one aeons\u2019 of time period, only seven Buddhas appeared in the world! Buddhas appear at vast intervals of time and rest of the long, long period the world is Buddha-less (<i>abuddhassa</i>)! Because of none appearance of  Buddha the world is merge in darkness of ignorance! Perhaps not a pleasant place to be.\n\n\t\n\n\tThe other important factor is only the fully-enlightened Buddhas are capable of teaching Dhamma: to lead devas and humans towards the freedom from Samsara suffering. According to scriptures time to time Pacceka-Buddhas (solitary buddhas or private buddhas) who are enlightened noble ones appears but they are not able to teach Dahmma or to establish dispensation to flourish Dhamma (which would thrive even after the passing away of a Samma Sam Buddha). \n\n\tSamma Sam Buddha is the supreme physician who would attends to worldly illness, through his universal compassion and deep wisdom about the world, he could give proper treatment to cure worldly illness. According to Dhammachakkapavthvana sutta, only the \n\n\tSamma Sam Buddha could role the \u2018Wheel of the Dhamma\u2019 \u2014no other being can stop! Once, rolled it would keep on rolling till the dispensation of the Buddha vanished form the earth. \n\n\tThis encourage and comfort the followers of the Blessed One, that they could still live in an era where the Dhamma proclaimed by the Buddha is available, even now in this 21<sup>st</sup> century!  We can see that we are fortunate, we have some idea of the Buddha and his teaching and we also established in faith of the Triple Gem to follow the Dhamma. Therefore, we have a choice, either we would follow his guidance, and practice as lay followers and develop wholesome activities in order to live peacefully and happily in this life and lives to come! Or if we have more wisdom and courage, we can be monastics and enhance our spiritual life, extend support to other beings by spreading the good Dhamma, proclaimed by the Blessed One, our Teacher, the Buddha Gotama. That is the only way we can honour and repay the Blessed One who by his own wisdom and effort got break through and showed us the true way. Later in this compilation we can see his untiring service to the world from age 35 to 80, till his final passing away. Samma Sam Buddha is the one who has proper and complete understanding of the entire humanity-the entire world and who could guide beings safely across to the other shore.\n\n\t\n\n\t<b>\u25b2 Events occurred soon after the Enlightenment</b>\n\n\tIn here we would like to present a few selected incidents happened after the Buddha\u2019s attainment of Nibb\u0101na. It is important to have some knowledge of them as we could see how the newly enlightened Buddha faced the world! These things also would keep us alert in the snares of worldly things waiting behind us to take us out from the spiritual path. There is no one in the three worlds who could trap the Samma Sam Buddha into sensual world. However, those who desire to develop spirituality has to be aware of such traps.\n\n\t\n\n\t<b>\u2666 E</b><b>ncounters with M\u0101ra and Mara\u2019s daughter\u2019s </b>\n\n\tAfter the bodhisattva became fully enlightened Buddha, the M\u0101ra again visited the Blessed One when he was dwelling immersed in the bliss of sam\u0101dhi, at Uruvel\u0101 on the bank of the river Nera\u00f1jar\u0101 at the foot of the Goatherd\u2019s Banyan Tree. M\u0101ra was not sure about the bodhisattva\u2019s supreme liberation, so he approached the Buddha and said:\n\n\t\n\n\t\u201cHaving deviated from the austere practice\n\n\tBy which men purify themselves,\n\n\tBeing impure, you think you\u2019re pure:\n\n\tYou have missed the path to purity\u201d\n\n\t\n\n\t<b>The Blessed One replied:</b>\n\n\t\u201cHaving known as useless any austerity \n\n\tAimed at the immortal state,\n\n\tThat all such penances are futile \n\n\tLike oars and rudder on dry land, \n\n\tBy developing the path to enlightenment\u2014\n\n\tVirtue, Sm\u0101dhi, and wisdom\u2014\n\n\tI have attained supreme purity:\n\n\tYou\u2019re defeated, End-maker!\u201d  ----endnote23----\n\n\t\n\n\tAt the end, M\u0101ra realising that he is not able to catch the Buddha in his snare, defeated and disappointed went away like a crow, who attacked a piece of stone thinking it was tasty food. ----endnote24---- \n\n\t<b>Daughter\u2019s of M\u0101ra tried to snare the Blessed One</b>\n\n\tAccording to scriptures, M\u0101ra having disappointed and saddened by his defeat went away and sat not far from where the Buddha sat. At this point, his daughters, Ta\u1e47h\u0101, Arat\u012b, and Rag\u0101 came to him and inquired regarding the reason for his dismay and sadness. M\u0101ra said this:\n\n\t<i>\u201cThe Arahant, the Fortunate One in the world, \u2026 has gone beyond M\u0101ra\u2019s realm: therefore, I sorrow so bitterly.\u201d </i>----endnote25----\n\n\tThen the three daughters assured their father that with their beauty and charm they could catch him:\n\n\t<i>\u201c \u2026we will catch him with the snare of lust, as they catch the forest elephant, we will bind him tightly and bring him back, and he will be under your control\u2026\u201d. </i>\n\n\tSo, the three daughters of M\u0101ra went near the Blessed One and addressed him with sweet and charming voices: \n\n\t\u201c<i>We serve at your feet, ascetic</i>\u2026\u201d \n\n\tThe Blessed One who has gone beyond lust, hate and delusion, did not pay any attention to them. They were so amazed that they could not captured the attention of the Buddha by their beauty, their lustful singing and dancing. They, talked among themselves of their failed actions:\n\n\t\n\n\t<i>\u201cIf we had assailed with such tactics any ascetic\u2026who was not devoid of lust, either his heart would have burst, or he would have vomited hot blood from his mouth, or he would have gone mad or become mentally deranged\u2026</i><i> </i><i>what our father told us is true\u2026\u201d </i>\n\n\t\n\n\tFailed to trap the Blessed One in their snare, the daughters departed with disappointment. \n\n\tAt the end of the sutta there is a statement to this effect:\n\n\t\n\n\t<i> \u201cThey had come to him glittering with beauty- </i>\n<i>Ta\u1e47h\u0101, Arat\u012b, and Rag\u0101- </i>\n<i>But the Teacher swept them away right there </i>\n<i>as the wind, a fallen cotton tuft\u201d</i>----endnote26----\n\n\t\n\n\t<b>\u2666 Dhamma lessons to be learn from this event</b>: \n\n\t1) Establishment of Right View is important in the Spiritual Path 2) to understand the uselessness of practicing austerities for spiritual development. Here we can see that from his own experience the bodhisatta, learned to abandon the wrong view as soon as he realised it, he dropped the obscure practice and straighten his right view. This experience cautions us to avoid the wrong views if we wish to develop our spiritual practice and follow the Right View disclosed by the Buddha.

Here, what we have to point out is that the night of awakening as a \u2018Fully Enlighted One\u2019 \u2013 by himself through his great insight and deep wisdom, the Blessed One understood all the doctrines in the world. To stress this point we can look in to Sela Sutta (MN: 92) what the Buddha said to Brahamin Sela: \n<i>What must be known is directly known, </i>\n<i>What must be developed has been developed, </i>\n<i>What must be abandoned has been abandoned, </i>\n<i>Therefore, brahmin, I am a Buddha.</i>\n\u201cVery frequently, we find that the Buddha expressed His experience of enlightenment in one of two ways, either in terms of having understood the Four Noble Truths, or in terms of having understood the nature of dependent origination. Again, the Buddha has often mentioned that in order to attain enlightenment one has to understand the Four Noble Truths; or similarly, one has to understand dependent origination\u201d.\n\n<b>Quote from</b> <a href=\"http://www.buddhanet.net/funbud12.htm\">http://www.buddhanet.net/funbud12.htm</a>\n\n\t\n\n\t\u2666 <b>Who is an Arahant? </b>\n\n\tThis also the very first time we see in the scriptures defining \u2018who is an arahant?\u2019 \n\n\tWhen the newly enlightened Buddha was spending his blissful time around Bodh Gaya, a brahmin from nearby village approached him and inquired of the qualities of a brahmin.

Scriptures mentioned an encounter taken place at that time: a Naga King called Muchalinda, who had seen the Buddha in deep meditation during a heavy storm gave him protection by wrapping his body with his serpent-coils and putting his hood over the head. When the Buddha came out from the meditation and realising what the Naga King did uttered the following Udana showing the important of harmless practice towards all living beings.  This remind us of the Metta Sutta where the Buddha said that \u2018spreading loving kindness to all beings\u2019 is a quality important to tread on the Noble Path.\n\u201c<i>Seclusion is bliss for the contented </i>\n<i>Who sees the Teaching that they have learned. </i>\n<i>Kindness to the world is happiness,</i>\n<i>For one who\u2019s harmless to living beings.</i>\n<i>Dispassion for the world is happiness, </i>\n<i>For one who overcomes sensuality.</i>\n<i>But removing the conceit \u2018I am\u2019,</i>\n<i>This, indeed, is the highest bliss.\u201d </i>----endnote38----\n\n\n\n----media/image9.jpeg----<b>Note</b>: Apart from being harmless, in here we can see some other essential qualities supporting the spirituality such as seclusion, loving kindness (metta) to all, dispassion towards worldly things and abandon of conceit.\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t<b>Muchalinda Naga giving protection to the Buddha</b>\n\n12th century Naga-enthroned Buddha Cambodia.\u00a0\n\nPicture courtesy: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Museum_of_Art\"><u>Cleveland Museum of Art</u></a>: OH, USA.\n\u25b2 <b>To Honour the Dhamma</b>\nOn one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Uruvel\u0101 on the bank of the river\nNera\u00f1jar\u0101 at the foot of the Goatherd\u2019s Banyan Tree just after he had become fully enlightened a reflection arose in his mind thus: ----endnote39----\n\n\n\n<i>\u201cOne dwells in suffering if one is without reverence and deference.

This is a very important message to Buddhists- to understands the significant of the Dhamma- the teaching, he stressed this point on his last days of life conveying the important message \u2013 saying when the Buddha is no more \u2013 Dhamma will guide everyone.

He reflected thus:\n\u201c<i>I have discovered this profound truth, so hard to see, so hard to comprehend.

In the history of dispensation, of the Buddha, we can see that the first stone of the foundation of the Fourfold Sangha was laid during this time.  This is what happened. At that time, two brothers Tapussa and Bhallika, who were travelling from Ukkal\u0101 to Uruvela, near the place of enlightenment, on an advice of a deva, made some food offering to the Buddha. After offering the meal, they paid homage to the Buddha and asked him to accept them as lay followers ----endnote43----. \n<b>Note</b>: In the establishment of the dispensation, the Blessed One knowing the important of disciples of monks and nuns, also encouraged lay followers to be his disciples, for their own enhancement in spirituality and also to support monastic with four requisites which is essential for their survival. We can see that During the time of the Blessed One and after his passing away- up to the present time, due to the unwavering support of lay devotees, the dispensation of the Buddha still continues to grow and shine in the world!\n\n----media/image11.jpeg----<b>Tapussa and Bhallika</b>, <b>offering food to the Blessed One</b>-Peshawar Museum: Picture courtesy: Wikipedia. \n\n\t\n\n\u25b2 <b>First instance of the Devas\u2019 and non-humans paying homage</b>\nOften scriptures as well as legend bring stories on how devas or non-humans like Naga Kings paying homage to the Blessed One and asking question pertain to Dhamma and or listening to Dhamma discourses given by the Buddha.

The Right Effort (samma vayama), as outlined in the Eightfold Noble Truths, is vital for spiritual growth: right effort to eliminate existing evils, to prevent existing evils from arising, to enhance the existing merits, and to continue to acquire new merits. This is one of the essential factors-helping hand to achieve the goal.</p>\n<p>* Tradition says that in the morning of the day of enlightenment the bodhisatta partook milk rice offered by a maiden named Sujata, daughter of householder of nearby Senani village. Though the scriptures have no record of this event we can see a reference to her in the AN1: 258, the Blessed One declaring: <i>\u201c\u2026</i><b><i>the foremost of my female lay followers in being the first to go for refuge is Suj\u0101t\u0101</i></b><i>, daughter of Sen\u0101n\u012b</i>\u201d. (She offered the bodhisatta his last meal before his enlightenment see: AN: Notes: 139). <span id=\"Endnote9\">[<a href=\"#endnote9\">9</a>]</span>. In  Mahaparinibbana sutta (DN:16)there is a statement about alms offering to the Buddha:</p>\n<p><i>\u201c\u2026</i><b><i>that these two alms-givings\u2019</i></b><i> are of very great fruit, of very great result, more fruitful and advantageous than any other. Which two? The one is the alms-giving after eating which the Tath\u0101gata attains supreme enlightenment, the other that after which he attains the Nibbana-element without remainder at his final passing\u201d.</i> As we know from the sutta that Cunda offered the last meal. It is not mentioned here that who had offered the first meal? If we go by legend, we can assume that Sujata offered the meal to the Buddha to be before his supreme enlightenment!</p>\n<p>If we ponder little further about the Buddha \u2018s statement regarding Sujata being the foremost lay woman to go for refuge to him, we may see her as the fist woman who paid homage to the Buddha after his enlightenment? AN1 (XIV Foremost Chapter) all the others described there were persons who have gone to the refuge of the Buddha after his enlightenment. In the case of Thapassu and Ballika two brothers mentioned in AN1:248. thus: \u201c<i>Bhikkhus, the foremost of my male lay followers in being the first to go for refuge are the merchants Tapussa and Bhallika\u201d. </i>According to Vinaya Pitaka :\u201c\u2026<i>When Tapussa and Bhallika knew that the Buddha had finished his meal, they bowed down with their head at his feet, and said, \u201cSir, we go for refuge to the Buddha and the Teaching.

He has no teacher, he declares that path for the happiness of all the beings. From the following statement by Venerable \u0100nanda confirmed this:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\u201c\u2026the Blessed One, accomplished and fully enlightened. For the Blessed One was the arouser of the unarisen path, the producer of the unproduced path, the declarer of the undeclared path; he was the knower of the path, the finder of the path, the one skilled in the path\u2026\u201d.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>MN:108</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>With all the testimony stated above, we can confirm that the presence of a Samma Sam Buddha in the world is extraordinary thing! A significant thing!  <b>Why is that?</b></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Appearance of a Buddha in a world is amazing and very rare thing. According to Mah\u00e2pad\u0101na Sutta (DN:14) during the last \u2018ninety-one aeons\u2019 of time period, only seven Buddhas appeared in the world! Buddhas appear at vast intervals of time and rest of the long, long period the world is Buddha-less (<i>abuddhassa</i>)! Because of none appearance of  Buddha the world is merge in darkness of ignorance! Perhaps not a pleasant place to be.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The other important factor is only the fully-enlightened Buddhas are capable of teaching Dhamma: to lead devas and humans towards the freedom from Samsara suffering. According to scriptures time to time Pacceka-Buddhas (solitary buddhas or private buddhas) who are enlightened noble ones appears but they are not able to teach Dahmma or to establish dispensation to flourish Dhamma (which would thrive even after the passing away of a Samma Sam Buddha).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Samma Sam Buddha is the supreme physician who would attends to worldly illness, through his universal compassion and deep wisdom about the world, he could give proper treatment to cure worldly illness. According to Dhammachakkapavthvana sutta, only the</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Samma Sam Buddha could role the \u2018Wheel of the Dhamma\u2019 \u2014no other being can stop! Once, rolled it would keep on rolling till the dispensation of the Buddha vanished form the earth.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This encourage and comfort the followers of the Blessed One, that they could still live in an era where the Dhamma proclaimed by the Buddha is available, even now in this 21<sup>st</sup> century!  We can see that we are fortunate, we have some idea of the Buddha and his teaching and we also established in faith of the Triple Gem to follow the Dhamma. Therefore, we have a choice, either we would follow his guidance, and practice as lay followers and develop wholesome activities in order to live peacefully and happily in this life and lives to come! Or if we have more wisdom and courage, we can be monastics and enhance our spiritual life, extend support to other beings by spreading the good Dhamma, proclaimed by the Blessed One, our Teacher, the Buddha Gotama. That is the only way we can honour and repay the Blessed One who by his own wisdom and effort got break through and showed us the true way. Later in this compilation we can see his untiring service to the world from age 35 to 80, till his final passing away. Samma Sam Buddha is the one who has proper and complete understanding of the entire humanity-the entire world and who could guide beings safely across to the other shore.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>\u25b2 Events occurred soon after the Enlightenment</b></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In here we would like to present a few selected incidents happened after the Buddha\u2019s attainment of Nibb\u0101na. It is important to have some knowledge of them as we could see how the newly enlightened Buddha faced the world! These things also would keep us alert in the snares of worldly things waiting behind us to take us out from the spiritual path. There is no one in the three worlds who could trap the Samma Sam Buddha into sensual world. However, those who desire to develop spirituality has to be aware of such traps.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>\u2666 E</b><b>ncounters with M\u0101ra and Mara\u2019s daughter\u2019s </b></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>After the bodhisattva became fully enlightened Buddha, the M\u0101ra again visited the Blessed One when he was dwelling immersed in the bliss of sam\u0101dhi, at Uruvel\u0101 on the bank of the river Nera\u00f1jar\u0101 at the foot of the Goatherd\u2019s Banyan Tree.

This experience cautions us to avoid the wrong views if we wish to develop our spiritual practice and follow the Right View disclosed by the Buddha.

When the Buddha came out from the meditation and realising what the Naga King did uttered the following Udana showing the important of harmless practice towards all living beings.

Many of the early disciples of the Buddha\u2019s order were students of other religious leaders, or people who followed other philosophies or views. In most cases, they have seen the Blessed One, heard the Dhamma, become inspired by his wisdom and compassion and thus established faith in him. Similarly, if someone is not interested in living the monastic life or does not have the strength to continue, there is no obstacle to disrobe and return to lay life. However, for the welfare of other students, the Buddha has advised that proper steps should be taken to remove those who do not behave in accordance with Vinaya rules.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><img src=\"page11_1/image1.jpeg\" /></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>The Buddha Teaching monks</b>: Picture courtesy Gettyimages</p>\n<h2>\u25b2<b>To Follow the Middle Way\u2014The Noble Eightfold Path</b></h2>\n<p>The Buddha often expressed to the Sangha his own experience in seeking the truth\u2014an escape from worldly suffering.  As a prince from royal family, he had all the pleasures of the world (see: section 1 &amp; 2) so he understood how sensuality bonds a person to the worldly life. Then as an ascetic, he practiced extreme austere practices thinking it would lead him to</p>\n<p>Enlightenment. Finally, through his wisdom and effort he achieved freedom from suffering (see Sections 3 &amp; 4). Hence, the Blessed One advised his disciples: not to be indulge in sensual pleasures, nor follow extreme practices that torment the body which will lead to a disturb mind.

One is the development of serenity (samatha), which aims at concentration (sam\u0101dhi); the other is the development of insight (vipassan\u0101), which aims at understanding or wisdom (pa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101). In the Buddha\u2019s system of mental training the role of serenity is subordinated to that of insight because the latter is the crucial instrument needed to uproot the ignorance at the bottom of sa\u1e41s\u0101ric bondage. The attainments possible through serenity meditation were known to Indian contemplatives long before the advent of the Buddha. The Buddha himself mastered the two highest stages under his early teachers but found that, on their own, they only led to higher planes of rebirth, not to genuine enlightenment (MN 26.15\u201316). However, because the unification of mind induced by the practice of concentration contributes to clear understanding, the Buddha incorporated the techniques of serenity meditation and the resulting levels of absorption into his own system, treating them as a foundation and preparation for insight and as a \u201cpleasant abiding here and now\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p><b>Quote from Bhikkhu Bodhi</b> (MN: Introduction)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>\u2666 Commending Meditation</b></p>\n<p>In his teaching the Blessed One often pointed out that Samadhi and wisdom go hand in hand. Therefore, he emphasised meditation and urged the Sangha to meditate and achieve stillness of the mind. He often pointed out that the final liberation cannot be perceived by those who are immersed in lust, hate and delusion.

The entire Buddhist world is indebted to the Buddha Gotama, who embarked on such a noble task \u2013 he renounced his princely life at a very young age in order to find a solution to the cycle of repeated suffering. The story of the Great Renunciation of Prince Siddhartha sets the example of going forth from lay life to homeless life for all Buddhist monks and nuns in our world. Thus, reflecting of the suffering of <i>sams\u0101ra</i>, the prince saw that if he took up the homeless life, it would be possible for him to seek what he wanted, the solution to the suffering of endless births and deaths.</p>\n<p>Before going to say about the wanderings of Ascetic Siddhartha we would like to present the causes which lead the prince to go forth from his princely life.</p>\n<h2>\u25b2 <b>What Inspired Prince Siddhartha to become an ascetic?</b></h2>\n<p>In a few suttas in the scriptures the Buddha has mentioned about his renunciation. Some of them are given below so that we could understand how one who was immensely involved in a princely life decided to give away his belongings and attachments and go away to unknown world of homelessness. In the following sutta the Blessed One, tells the Sangha what it was that inspired him to become a homeless wander.</p>\n<p>\u2666 <b>Seen the suffering of life</b></p>\n<p><i>\u201cAmid such splendour and a delicate life, it occurred to me: \u2026I too am subject to </i><b><i>old age </i></b><i>and am not exempt from old age.

Thus, Prince Siddhartha, who had well understood the intoxication of youth\u2026health, and \u2026 life, was undoubtedly shocked by the pleasures of the sensual world. As mentioned earlier (in section 2), he must have realized that the well-being and happiness obtained through Samadhi is more superior than worldly pleasures. He must have realized that everyone, including himself, is subject to the stages of old age, illness, and death. At that time, according to Indian religious beliefs he may had some idea of rebirth- not one- but many? He may have pondered how to escape from such a deadly trap?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Accordingly, he left home searching a way out from worldly suffering, seeking the Truth -Good (<i>ki\u1e43kusal\u0101nues\u012b)</i></p>\n<p>Thus, reflecting on these problems, <b>old age, sickness and death</b>, Prince Siddhartha saw the reality of life, that everyone who is born is subject to these. The prince realised that not only himself, but also all the people he loved and in fact all the beings who are born are overwhelmed by the inevitable great sorrow of old age, sickness and death. Moreover, it was believed that this cycle of being born and dying (<i>sams\u0101ra</i>) was endless. Prince Siddhartha renounced his princely life in order to find a way out of these eternal problems, looking for a blissful state.</p>\n<p>* Later, when he became the Buddha, he said this about his noble search:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cAnd what is the noble search?

Traditional stories about the life of the Buddha often say that Prince Siddhartha left his family without telling them the purpose of his going away. However, in the Suttas we can see a different picture. The Buddha says this to the Sangha:</p>\n<p><i> \u2018Why, being myself subject to birth, do I seek what is also subject to birth? Why, being myself subject to ageing, sickness, death, sorrow, and defilement, do I seek what is also subject to ageing, sickness, death, sorrow, and defilement? Suppose that, being myself subject to birth, having understood the danger in what is subject to birth, I seek the unborn supreme security from bondage... later, while still young, a black-haired young man endowed with the blessing of youth, in the prime of life, </i><b><i>though my mother and father wished otherwise and wept with tearful faces,</i></b><i> I shaved off my hair and beard, put on the yellow robe, and went forth from the home life into homelessness\u2026\u201d</i> <span id=\"Endnote10\">[<a href=\"#endnote10\">10</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Although he was young and lived a luxurious princely life, Prince Siddhartha had understood the true nature of existence, that the pleasures of life were very limited and would inevitably be followed by suffering. He may have discussed these things with his beloved Princess Yasodhara, who was also a wise lady and devoted wife. According to Jataka Stories, for countless life-times they had been husband and wife devoted to each other. In those previous lives, when our bodhisattva went forth from the home life, his wife supported him and helped him. So, in the present life also they may have held many discussions about the unsatisfactoriness of lay life and she may have understood the desire of the prince to seek the Truth.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, when the Blessed One visited his family in Kapilvatthu, Yasodhara Devi, pointed out the Buddha to her son Rahula, telling him that the Buddha was his father, and sent Prince Rahula to the Buddha to ask for the bequest due to him <span id=\"Endnote11\">[<a href=\"#endnote11\">11</a>]</span>.</p>\n<p>What gift can a Buddha give to his son? A Samma Sambudha has no material endowment to offer; all he has to give his son is the way to be free from <i>sams\u0101ra</i> suffering and attain the bliss of liberation. As a wise and loving mother who understood this, Princess Yasodhara acted in such a noble way, directing her beloved son to obtain the greatest gift in the world!  Hence, we can conclude that it is not a very realistic story that the bodhisattva, the future Buddha who had a heart full of love and compassion towards his parents, his wife and the family ran away in the dead of night without letting them know his purpose of going forth.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><img src=\"page3/image3.jpeg\" /></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>Above</b>: <b>Prince Siddhartha leaves the Palace riding his horse amidst gathering of his family and friends:</b> Picture courtesy: Wikipedia: Source: Pakistan, Gandhara, schist, 2nd-3rd century, San Diego Museum of Art</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>\u25b2 Wanderings of Asetc Siddhartha</b></p>\n<p>In here we have gathered certain information from the scriptures, showing the activities of ascetic Siddhartha, the places he visited and people he met during the 6 years of his ascetic life.

He betook himself for alms, -replete with excellent marks- Bimbis\u0101ra saw him\u00a0while standing atop his longhouse. Noticing that he was endowed with marks he said the following:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\u2018Pay heed, sirs, to this one, - handsome, majestic, radiant;</i></p>\n<p><i>accomplished in deportment, - he looks just a plough\u2019s length in front.</i></p>\n<p><i>Eyes downcast, mindful, - unlike one from a low family.</i></p>\n<p><i>Let the king\u2019s messengers run out, - and find where the mendicant will go.\u201d</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Then the king went to the place where the ascetic Siddhartha was, greeted him graciously and said this:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\u201cYou are just a youth \u2013 a lad in the prime of life.</i></p>\n<p><i>You are endowed with beauty and stature, - Like an aristocrat of good birth.</i></p>\n<p><i>In glory at the army\u2019s head- surrounded by a troop of elephants.</i></p>\n<p><i>I offer you pleasures \u2013 enjoy them! - But please tell me of your birth.\u201d</i></p>\n<p><b>Note</b>: Then the Ascetic Siddhartha refused the royal offer saying: <i>\u201c</i><b><i>Seeing the danger in sensual pleasures, - Seeing renunciation as sanctuary, I shall go on to strive; - that is where my mind delights\u201d</i></b><i>.</i> This is the first instance we see in the scriptures the reason for going forth. His determination not to go for royal pleasures again- indulge in sensual pleasures- is an important point for a monk or a nun who has gone forth to make a determination, not to abandon the practice for sensual pleasures.

Though the scriptures have no record of this event we can see a reference to her in the AN1: 258, the Blessed One declaring: <i>\u201c\u2026</i><b><i>the foremost of my female lay followers in being the first to go for refuge is Suj\u0101t\u0101</i></b><i>, daughter of Sen\u0101n\u012b</i>\u201d.

Which two? The one is the alms-giving after eating which the Tath\u0101gata attains supreme enlightenment, the other that after which he attains the Nibbana-element without remainder at his final passing\u201d.</i> As we know from the sutta that Cunda offered the last meal. It is not mentioned here that who had offered the first meal? If we go by legend, we can assume that Sujata offered the meal to the Buddha to be before his supreme enlightenment!</p>\n<p>If we ponder little further about the Buddha \u2018s statement regarding Sujata being the foremost lay woman to go for refuge to him, we may see her as the fist woman who paid homage to the Buddha after his enlightenment?

A significant thing!  <b>Why is that?</b></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Appearance of a Buddha in a world is amazing and very rare thing. According to Mah\u00e2pad\u0101na Sutta (DN:14) during the last \u2018ninety-one aeons\u2019 of time period, only seven Buddhas appeared in the world! Buddhas appear at vast intervals of time and rest of the long, long period the world is Buddha-less (<i>abuddhassa</i>)! Because of none appearance of  Buddha the world is merge in darkness of ignorance! Perhaps not a pleasant place to be.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The other important factor is only the fully-enlightened Buddhas are capable of teaching Dhamma: to lead devas and humans towards the freedom from Samsara suffering. According to scriptures time to time Pacceka-Buddhas (solitary buddhas or private buddhas) who are enlightened noble ones appears but they are not able to teach Dahmma or to establish dispensation to flourish Dhamma (which would thrive even after the passing away of a Samma Sam Buddha).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Samma Sam Buddha is the supreme physician who would attends to worldly illness, through his universal compassion and deep wisdom about the world, he could give proper treatment to cure worldly illness. According to Dhammachakkapavthvana sutta, only the</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Samma Sam Buddha could role the \u2018Wheel of the Dhamma\u2019 \u2014no other being can stop! Once, rolled it would keep on rolling till the dispensation of the Buddha vanished form the earth.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This encourage and comfort the followers of the Blessed One, that they could still live in an era where the Dhamma proclaimed by the Buddha is available, even now in this 21<sup>st</sup> century!  We can see that we are fortunate, we have some idea of the Buddha and his teaching and we also established in faith of the Triple Gem to follow the Dhamma. Therefore, we have a choice, either we would follow his guidance, and practice as lay followers and develop wholesome activities in order to live peacefully and happily in this life and lives to come! Or if we have more wisdom and courage, we can be monastics and enhance our spiritual life, extend support to other beings by spreading the good Dhamma, proclaimed by the Blessed One, our Teacher, the Buddha Gotama. That is the only way we can honour and repay the Blessed One who by his own wisdom and effort got break through and showed us the true way. Later in this compilation we can see his untiring service to the world from age 35 to 80, till his final passing away. Samma Sam Buddha is the one who has proper and complete understanding of the entire humanity-the entire world and who could guide beings safely across to the other shore.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>\u25b2 Events occurred soon after the Enlightenment</b></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In here we would like to present a few selected incidents happened after the Buddha\u2019s attainment of Nibb\u0101na.

These things also would keep us alert in the snares of worldly things waiting behind us to take us out from the spiritual path.

Sometimes the texts use the word \u201cM\u0101ra\u201d in a metaphorical sense, as representing the inward psychological causes of bondage such as craving and lust and the external things to which we become bound, particularly the five aggregates themselves. But it is evident that the thought world of the suttas does not conceive M\u0101ra only as a personification of humankind\u2019s moral frailty, but sees him as a real evil deity out to frustrate the efforts of those intent on winning the ultimate goal. The proof of this lies in his pursuit of the Buddha and the arahants after their enlightenment, which would not be credible if he were conceived of merely as a psychological projection. <b>See</b>: SN: Introduction to Sgathavagga, 4.

This is one of the essential factors-helping hand to achieve the goal.</p>\n<p>* Tradition says that in the morning of the day of enlightenment the bodhisatta partook milk rice offered by a maiden named Sujata, daughter of householder of nearby Senani village. Though the scriptures have no record of this event we can see a reference to her in the AN1: 258, the Blessed One declaring: <i>\u201c\u2026</i><b><i>the foremost of my female lay followers in being the first to go for refuge is Suj\u0101t\u0101</i></b><i>, daughter of Sen\u0101n\u012b</i>\u201d. (She offered the bodhisatta his last meal before his enlightenment see: AN: Notes: 139). ----endnote9----. In  Mahaparinibbana sutta (DN:16)there is a statement about alms offering to the Buddha:</p>\n<p><i>\u201c\u2026</i><b><i>that these two alms-givings\u2019</i></b><i> are of very great fruit, of very great result, more fruitful and advantageous than any other. Which two? The one is the alms-giving after eating which the Tath\u0101gata attains supreme enlightenment, the other that after which he attains the Nibbana-element without remainder at his final passing\u201d.</i> As we know from the sutta that Cunda offered the last meal. It is not mentioned here that who had offered the first meal? If we go by legend, we can assume that Sujata offered the meal to the Buddha to be before his supreme enlightenment!</p>\n<p>If we ponder little further about the Buddha \u2018s statement regarding Sujata being the foremost lay woman to go for refuge to him, we may see her as the fist woman who paid homage to the Buddha after his enlightenment?

A significant thing!  <b>Why is that?</b></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Appearance of a Buddha in a world is amazing and very rare thing. According to Mah\u00e2pad\u0101na Sutta (DN:14) during the last \u2018ninety-one aeons\u2019 of time period, only seven Buddhas appeared in the world! Buddhas appear at vast intervals of time and rest of the long, long period the world is Buddha-less (<i>abuddhassa</i>)! Because of none appearance of  Buddha the world is merge in darkness of ignorance! Perhaps not a pleasant place to be.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The other important factor is only the fully-enlightened Buddhas are capable of teaching Dhamma: to lead devas and humans towards the freedom from Samsara suffering. According to scriptures time to time Pacceka-Buddhas (solitary buddhas or private buddhas) who are enlightened noble ones appears but they are not able to teach Dahmma or to establish dispensation to flourish Dhamma (which would thrive even after the passing away of a Samma Sam Buddha).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Samma Sam Buddha is the supreme physician who would attends to worldly illness, through his universal compassion and deep wisdom about the world, he could give proper treatment to cure worldly illness. According to Dhammachakkapavthvana sutta, only the</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Samma Sam Buddha could role the \u2018Wheel of the Dhamma\u2019 \u2014no other being can stop! Once, rolled it would keep on rolling till the dispensation of the Buddha vanished form the earth.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This encourage and comfort the followers of the Blessed One, that they could still live in an era where the Dhamma proclaimed by the Buddha is available, even now in this 21<sup>st</sup> century!  We can see that we are fortunate, we have some idea of the Buddha and his teaching and we also established in faith of the Triple Gem to follow the Dhamma. Therefore, we have a choice, either we would follow his guidance, and practice as lay followers and develop wholesome activities in order to live peacefully and happily in this life and lives to come! Or if we have more wisdom and courage, we can be monastics and enhance our spiritual life, extend support to other beings by spreading the good Dhamma, proclaimed by the Blessed One, our Teacher, the Buddha Gotama. That is the only way we can honour and repay the Blessed One who by his own wisdom and effort got break through and showed us the true way. Later in this compilation we can see his untiring service to the world from age 35 to 80, till his final passing away. Samma Sam Buddha is the one who has proper and complete understanding of the entire humanity-the entire world and who could guide beings safely across to the other shore.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>\u25b2 Events occurred soon after the Enlightenment</b></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In here we would like to present a few selected incidents happened after the Buddha\u2019s attainment of Nibb\u0101na.

These things also would keep us alert in the snares of worldly things waiting behind us to take us out from the spiritual path.

    "page4_org": "<h1>Section 4: Enlightenment of Buddha Gotama- at Age of 35</h1>\n<p>Tradition says that the Blessed One was enlighten in the year 589 B.C. at Bodh-gaya (then Uruvela) on a full moon day of month of May (Ves\u0101kha -Vesak)   .In this section we are going to focus on some important events prior to and following the noble enlightenment of the Blessed One.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Events Prior to Enlightenment:</h2>\n<p>Earlier (section 3) we have seen how Ascetic Siddhartha gave up his extreme austerities\u2014reflected on his meditative attainments at the age of seven, through his wisdom realised the way for liberation and prepared himself to gain physical strength to achieve it    . By this time the five group of ascetics who were attending to the bodhisatta were not happy about his new mode of practice, left him and went to the Deer Park at Isipatana  . The Bodhisatta stayed in the River Bank of Neranjana, in solitude and resolute, determined to strive for enlightenment! In the following sutta we can see how he defeated Mara and realized the noble state called \u2018superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones\u2019 (alm-ariya nanadassana vesesana)</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Five Great Dreams</h3>\n<p>In the following sutta the Buddha described the five dreams appeared to him before his enlightenment thus:</p>\n<em>\n<p>\u201cBhikkhus, before his enlightenment, while he was just a bodhisatta, not fully enlightened, five great dreams appeared to the Tath\u0101gata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One. What five?\u201d</p>\n</em>\n<p>1) he dreamt that this mighty earth was his bedstead; the Him\u0101laya, king of mountains, was his pillow; his left hand rested on the eastern sea, his right hand on the western sea, and his two feet on the southern sea\u2014the dream, represented his awakening to the unsurpassed, perfect enlightenment.</p>\n<p>2) he dreamt that a grass called tiriy\u0101 rose up from his navel and stood touching the sky \u2014the dream showing that he would awaken to the noble eightfold path and would proclaim it well among devas and humans.</p>\n<p>3) he dreamt that white worms with black heads crawled from his feet up to his knees and covered them\u2014the dream showing that many lay followers would follow his teachings.</p>\n<p>4) he dreamt that four birds of different colours came from the four quarters, fell at his feet, and turned all white\u2014the dream showing that members of the four classes\u2014</p>\n<p>khattiyas, brahmins, vessas, and suddas\u2014would go forth from the household life into homelessness and become his disciples.</p>\n<p>5) he dreamt that he climbed up a huge mountain of dung without being soiled by it\u2014the dream showing that he would receive the four requisites to sustain the homeless life  and he would use them without being tied to them, infatuated with them, and blindly absorbed in them, seeing the danger and knowing the escape  .</p>\n<p>Note: These dreams are like foretoken (pubbanimitta) indication that the bodhisatta would gain the Buddhahood in the near future.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Encounters with M\u0101ra</h3>\n<p>On the occasion when the bodhisattva was sitting in meditation under the assattha bo-tree  , in the bank of Neranjana river, M\u0101ra wanted to discourage bodhisattva from attending liberation, wanted to hold him in his grip. Below we can see a passage from Suttanipata, how the M\u0101ra, was trying to persuade the Bodisatta away from Buddhahood.</p>\n<p>The Buddha elaborates this event thus:</p>\n<div id=\"gatha\">\n<p>\u201cAs I strove to subdue myself</p>\n<p>beside the broad Nera\u00f1jar\u0101,</p>\n<p>absorbed unflinchingly to gain</p>\n<p>the surcease of bondage here,</p>\n<p>Namuc\u012b came and spoke to me</p>\n<p>with words all garbed in pity thus:</p>\n</div>\n<p>M\u0101ra</p>\n<div id=\"gatha\">\n<p>\u2018\u2026you are thin and you are pale,</p>\n<p>and you are in death\u2019s presence too:</p>\n<p>a thousand parts are pledged to death</p>\n<p>but life still holds one part of you.</p>\n<p>Live, sir! Life\u2019s the better way;</p>\n<p>you may gain merit if you live,</p>\n<p>come live the life of purity, pour</p>\n<p>libations on the holy fires</p>\n<p>and thus a world of merit gain.</p>\n<p>What can you do by struggling now?</p>\n<p>The path of struggling too is rough,</p>\n<p>and difficult and hard to bear\u2026\u2019</p>\n</div>\n<p>The Bodhisatta replied:</p>\n<div id=\"gatha\">\n<p>O Evil One, O Cousin of the Negligent,</p>\n<p>you have come here for your own ends.</p>\n<p>Now, merit I need not at all.</p>\n<p>Let M\u0101ra talk of merit then,</p>\n<p>to those that stand in need of it.</p>\n<p>For I have faith and energy,</p>\n<p>and I have understanding, too.</p>\n<p>So while I thus subdue myself,</p>\n<p>why do you speak to me of life?</p>\n<p>There is this wind that blows, can dry</p>\n<p>even the rivers\u2019 running streams;</p>\n<p>so while I thus subdue myself,</p>\n<p>why should it not dry up my blood?</p>\n<p>And, as the blood dries up, then bile</p>\n<p>and phlegm run dry, the wasting flesh</p>\n<p>becalms the mind: I shall have more</p>\n<p>of mindfulness and wisdom too,</p>\n<p>I shall have greater concentration.</p>\n<p>For living thus, I come to know</p>\n<p>the limits to which feeling goes.</p>\n<p>My mind looks not to sense-desires:</p>\n<p>Now see a being\u2019s purity\u2026\u201d</p>\n</div>\n<p>Having understood the unshakeable determination of the bodhisattva, and that he has no power to defeat him, with a heavy heart M\u0101ra went away.</p>\n<p><b>Note</b>: * The Dhamma message presented here is that unwavering effort is essential to tread on the spiritual path. The Right Effort (samma vayama), as outlined in the Eightfold Noble Truths, is vital for spiritual growth: right effort to eliminate existing evils, to prevent existing evils from arising, to enhance the existing merits, and to continue to acquire new merits. This is one of the essential factors-helping hand to achieve the goal.</p>\n<p>* Tradition says that in the morning of the day of enlightenment the bodhisatta partook milk rice offered by a maiden named Sujata, daughter of householder of nearby Senani village. Though the scriptures have no record of this event we can see a reference to her in the AN1: 258, the Blessed One declaring: <strong>\u201c\u2026the foremost of my female lay followers in being the first to go for refuge is Suj\u0101t\u0101, daughter of Sen\u0101n\u012b\u201d</strong>. (She offered the bodhisatta his last meal before his enlightenment see: AN: Notes: 139).  . In  Mahaparinibbana sutta (DN:16)there is a statement about alms offering to the Buddha:</p>\n<em>\n<p>\u201c\u2026that these two alms-givings\u2019 are of very great fruit, of very great result, more fruitful and advantageous than any other. Which two? The one is the alms-giving after eating which the Tath\u0101gata attains supreme enlightenment, the other that after which he attains the Nibbana-element without remainder at his final passing\u201d.</p>\n</em>\n<p>As we know from the sutta that Cunda offered the last meal. It is not mentioned here that who had offered the first meal? If we go by legend, we can assume that Sujata offered the meal to the Buddha to be before his supreme enlightenment!</p>\n<p>If we ponder little further about the Buddha \u2018s statement regarding Sujata being the foremost lay woman to go for refuge to him, we may see her as the fist woman who paid homage to the Buddha after his enlightenment? AN1 (XIV Foremost Chapter) all the others described there were persons who have gone to the refuge of the Buddha after his enlightenment. In the case of Thapassu and Ballika two brothers mentioned in AN1:248. thus: \u201cBhikkhus, the foremost of my male lay followers in being the first to go for refuge are the merchants Tapussa and Bhallika\u201d. According to Vinaya Pitaka :\u201c\u2026When Tapussa and Bhallika knew that the Buddha had finished his meal, they bowed down with their head at his feet, and said, \u201cSir, we go for refuge to the Buddha and the Teaching. Please accept us as lay followers who have gone for refuge for life.\u201d By means of the double refuge, they became the first lay followers in the world\u201d.    Hence, whether Sujata was paying respect to the bodhisatta and offered him his last meal or she was bowing down to the newly enlightened Buddha and offered him the first meal is uncertain.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Supreme Enlightenment -Samma Sam Bodhi</h2>\n<p>The Bodhisattvas, with a strong determination to attain liberation, increased his velour; through his effort and unwavering heedfulness, he strove and won the battle with M\u0101ra and his tenfold army, and attained the supreme enlightenment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>The Blessed One describes his effort and determination as thus:</h3>\n<em>\n<p>\u201c\u2026bhikkhus, \u2026I strove indefatigably\u2026 \u2018willingly, let only my skin, sinews, and bones remain, and let the flesh and blood dry up in my body, but I will not relax my energy so long as I have not attained what can be attained by manly strength, energy, and exertion.\u2019 It was by heedfulness that I achieved enlightenment, bhikkhus; it was by heedfulness that I achieved the unsurpassed security from bondage\u2026\u201d.</p>\n</em>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Full Enlightenment</h3>\n<p>In the following suttas the Blessed One stated about his enlightenment:</p>\n<em>\n<p>* \u201c...I am now the Arahant and fully enlightened Buddha, am of the Gotama clan\u2026I became fully enlightened at the foot of an assattha-tree\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>* \u201cThen, bhikkhus, being myself subject to birth\u2026ageing\u2026sickness\u2026death having understood the danger in what is subject to birth, ageing\u2026sickness\u2026death\u2026seeking the unborn\u2026 unageing\u2026 unailing \u2026deathless supreme security from bondage\u2026 I attained the\u2026 supreme security from bondage\u2026 Nibb\u0101na\u2026 I attained the sorrowless\u2026 undefiled\u2026 supreme security from bondage, Nibb\u0101na. The knowledge and vision arose in me: \u2018My deliverance is unshakeable; this is my last birth; now there is no renewal of being.\u2019\u201d</p>\n</em>\n<h3>The Path to Enlightenment</h3>\n<p>After he had become fully enlightened, the Buddha reflected on the path that led to his awakening. As he was dwelling at Uruvel\u0101 on the bank of the river Nera\u00f1jar\u0101 at the foot of the Goatherd\u2019s Banyan Tree he thought:</p>\n<em>\n<p>\u201cI am indeed freed from that gruelling asceticism! It is good indeed that I am freed from that useless gruelling asceticism! It is good that, steady and mindful, I have attained enlightenment!\u201d</p>\n<p>[add reference]</p>\n</em>\n<div id=\"gatha\">\n<p>Having known as useless any austerity</p>\n<p>Aimed at the immortal state,</p>\n<p>That all such penances are futile</p>\n<p>Like oars and rudder on dry land,</p>\n<p>By developing the path to enlightenment\u2014</p>\n<p>Virtue, concentration, and wisdom\u2014</p>\n<p>I have attained supreme purity:</p>\n<p>You are defeated, End-maker.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Quote from SN:4: 1 (Austere Practice sutta)</p>\n<p>Note: M\u0101ra is called the End-maker (antaka) because he binds beings to death. (see: SN: Note: 265).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>What is Full Enlightenment? \u2013 Definition of Samma Sambuddha</h2>\n<p>Samma Sam Buddha is one of the nine noble qualities attributed to Tath\u0101gata. The nine qualities are:</p>\n<em>\n<p>\u201c\u2026the Blessed One is an arahant, perfectly enlightened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, fortunate, knower of the world, unsurpassed trainer of persons to be tamed, teacher of devas and humans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One.\u2019</p>\n</em>\n<p></p>\n<p>When we see all the nine noble qualities attributed to the Blessed One, we could include all of them in to one term\u2014The Fully Enlightened One (Samma Sam Buddha). We can justify that claim by looking into noble nine qualities mentioned above:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1)  Arahant\u2014accomplished: Arahant: he has been freed from all the defilements of the worldly life; broken the cycle of samsara; abolished rebirth; and worthy of worship and respect from gods and humans</p>\n<p>2) <b>Samma Sam Buddha</b>\u2014 The Fully Enlightened One: he has discovered (buddha) all things rightly ( samm\u0101) and by himself (s\u0101mam), he fully understood the Four Noble Truths; he awakened from the great sleep of delusion; he attained the knowledge of omniscience.</p>\n<p>3)  <b>Vijj\u0101cara\u0146a sampanno</b> -Endowed with clear vision and virtuous conduct:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The scriptures mentioned three kinds of clear vision (knowledges) (te-Vijja\u2014Three knowledges) and also eight kinds of knowledges: Three Knowledges: 1. knowledge of the recollection of past lives (pubbe-niv\u0101s\u0101ussati \u00f1\u0101\u0146a) 2. knowledge of the passing away and reappearance of beings (dibba-cakkhu) 3.  knowledge of destruction of all taints ( \u0101savakkhaya \u00f1\u0101\u0146a)</p>\n<p>Eight kinds of knowledges\u20141-3 as mentioned above, 4.

He has no teacher, he declares that path for the happiness of all the beings. From the following statement by Venerable \u0100nanda confirmed this:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026the Blessed One, accomplished and fully enlightened. For the Blessed One was the arouser of the unarisen path, the producer of the unproduced path, the declarer of the undeclared path; he was the knower of the path, the finder of the path, the one skilled in the path\u2026\u201d.</p>\n<p>MN:108</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>With all the testimony stated above, we can confirm that the presence of a Samma Sam Buddha in the world is extraordinary thing! A significant thing!  Why is that?</p>\n<p>Appearance of a Buddha in a world is amazing and very rare thing. According to Mah\u00e2pad\u0101na Sutta (DN:14) during the last \u2018ninety-one aeons\u2019 of time period, only seven Buddhas appeared in the world! Buddhas appear at vast intervals of time and rest of the long, long period the world is Buddha-less (abuddhassa)! Because of none appearance of  Buddha the world is merge in darkness of ignorance! Perhaps not a pleasant place to be.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The other important factor is only the fully-enlightened Buddhas are capable of teaching Dhamma: to lead devas and humans towards the freedom from Samsara suffering. According to scriptures time to time Pacceka-Buddhas (solitary buddhas or private buddhas) who are enlightened noble ones appears but they are not able to teach Dahmma or to establish dispensation to flourish Dhamma (which would thrive even after the passing away of a Samma Sam Buddha).</p>\n<p>Samma Sam Buddha is the supreme physician who would attends to worldly illness, through his universal compassion and deep wisdom about the world, he could give proper treatment to cure worldly illness. According to Dhammachakkapavthvana sutta, only the</p>\n<p>Samma Sam Buddha could role the \u2018Wheel of the Dhamma\u2019 \u2014no other being can stop! Once, rolled it would keep on rolling till the dispensation of the Buddha vanished form the earth.</p>\n<p>This encourage and comfort the followers of the Blessed One, that they could still live in an era where the Dhamma proclaimed by the Buddha is available, even now in this 21st century!  We can see that we are fortunate, we have some idea of the Buddha and his teaching and we also established in faith of the Triple Gem to follow the Dhamma. Therefore, we have a choice, either we would follow his guidance, and practice as lay followers and develop wholesome activities in order to live peacefully and happily in this life and lives to come! Or if we have more wisdom and courage, we can be monastics and enhance our spiritual life, extend support to other beings by spreading the good Dhamma, proclaimed by the Blessed One, our Teacher, the Buddha Gotama. That is the only way we can honour and repay the Blessed One who by his own wisdom and effort got break through and showed us the true way. Later in this compilation we can see his untiring service to the world from age 35 to 80, till his final passing away. Samma Sam Buddha is the one who has proper and complete understanding of the entire humanity-the entire world and who could guide beings safely across to the other shore.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Events occurred soon after the Enlightenment</h2>\n<p>In here we would like to present a few selected incidents happened after the Buddha\u2019s attainment of Nibb\u0101na. It is important to have some knowledge of them as we could see how the newly enlightened Buddha faced the world! These things also would keep us alert in the snares of worldly things waiting behind us to take us out from the spiritual path. There is no one in the three worlds who could trap the Samma Sam Buddha into sensual world. However, those who desire to develop spirituality has to be aware of such traps.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Encounters with M\u0101ra and Mara\u2019s daughter\u2019s</h3>\n<p>After the bodhisattva became fully enlightened Buddha, the M\u0101ra again visited the Blessed One when he was dwelling immersed in the bliss of sam\u0101dhi, at Uruvel\u0101 on the bank of the river Nera\u00f1jar\u0101 at the foot of the Goatherd\u2019s Banyan Tree. M\u0101ra was not sure about the bodhisattva\u2019s supreme liberation, so he approached the Buddha and said:</p>\n<p></p>\n<pre>\n<p>\u201cHaving deviated from the austere practice</p>\n<p>By which men purify themselves,</p>\n<p>Being impure, you think you\u2019re pure:</p>\n<p>You have missed the path to purity\u201d</p>\n</pre>\n<p>The Blessed One replied:</p>\n<pre>\n<p>\u201cHaving known as useless any austerity</p>\n<p>Aimed at the immortal state,</p>\n<p>That all such penances are futile</p>\n<p>Like oars and rudder on dry land,</p>\n<p>By developing the path to enlightenment\u2014</p>\n<p>Virtue, Sm\u0101dhi, and wisdom\u2014</p>\n<p>I have attained supreme purity:</p>\n<p>You\u2019re defeated, End-maker!\u201d</p>\n</pre>\n<p></p>\n<p>At the end, M\u0101ra realising that he is not able to catch the Buddha in his snare, defeated and disappointed went away like a crow, who attacked a piece of stone thinking it was tasty food.</p>\n<p>Daughter\u2019s of M\u0101ra tried to snare the Blessed One</p>\n<p>According to scriptures, M\u0101ra having disappointed and saddened by his defeat went away and sat not far from where the Buddha sat. At this point, his daughters, Ta\u1e47h\u0101, Arat\u012b, and Rag\u0101 came to him and inquired regarding the reason for his dismay and sadness. M\u0101ra said this:</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Arahant, the Fortunate One in the world, \u2026 has gone beyond M\u0101ra\u2019s realm: therefore, I sorrow so bitterly.\u201d</p>\n<p>Then the three daughters assured their father that with their beauty and charm they could catch him:</p>\n<em>\n<p>\u201c \u2026we will catch him with the snare of lust, as they catch the forest elephant, we will bind him tightly and bring him back, and he will be under your control\u2026\u201d.</p>\n</em>\n<p>So, the three daughters of M\u0101ra went near the Blessed One and addressed him with sweet and charming voices:</p>\n<p>\u201cWe serve at your feet, ascetic\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>The Blessed One who has gone beyond lust, hate and delusion, did not pay any attention to them. They were so amazed that they could not captured the attention of the Buddha by their beauty, their lustful singing and dancing. They, talked among themselves of their failed actions:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cIf we had assailed with such tactics any ascetic\u2026who was not devoid of lust, either his heart would have burst, or he would have vomited hot blood from his mouth, or he would have gone mad or become mentally deranged\u2026 what our father told us is true\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Failed to trap the Blessed One in their snare, the daughters departed with disappointment.</p>\n<p>At the end of the sutta there is a statement to this effect:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cThey had come to him glittering with beauty-</p>\n<p>Ta\u1e47h\u0101, Arat\u012b, and Rag\u0101-</p>\n<p>But the Teacher swept them away right there</p>\n<p>as the wind, a fallen cotton tuft\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Dhamma lessons to be learn from this event:</h3>\n<p>1) Establishment of Right View is important in the Spiritual Path 2) to understand the uselessness of practicing austerities for spiritual development. Here we can see that from his own experience the bodhisatta, learned to abandon the wrong view as soon as he realised it, he dropped the obscure practice and straighten his right view. This experience cautions us to avoid the wrong views if we wish to develop our spiritual practice and follow the Right View disclosed by the Buddha. If one would wish to enhance the Dhamma, and to blind fold M\u0101ra, one must keep in mind what the Buddha said and practice accordingly.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>By developing the path to enlightenment\u2014</p>\n<p>Virtue, concentration, and wisdom\u2014</p>\n<p>I have attained supreme purity:</p>\n<p>You\u2019re defeated, End-maker!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>M\u0101ra\u2019s three daughters attempt to seduce the Buddha: Picture courtesy: https://au.pinterest.com/</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Peaceful abiding\u2019s soon after the enlightenment</h2>\n<p>According to Vinaya Pitaka   soon after the enlightenment, the Blessed One stayed near the river bank of Neranjana in meditative bliss for seven days in one place and moving to another and spending seven days etc. Summery of that time period is given below:</p>\n<p>First week: Foot of the Bodhi Tree reflecting on Dependent origination.</p>\n<p>Second week: Foot of the Goatherd\u2019s banyan tree where the Buddha had an encounter with a brahmin from a near by village.</p>\n<p>Third week: Foot of the Powderpuff tree, where the Buddha had an encounter with Naga Mucalinda.</p>\n<p>Fourth Week: Foot of the Ape-flower tree, Tapussa and Bhallika offered a meal to the Buddha and became lay followers (taking refuge in Buddha and the Dhamma), also deva\u2019s offering the first almas bowl.</p>\n<p>Fifth week: Foot of the Goatherd\u2019s banyan tree, reflecting on the profundity of the Dhamma, not inclined to teach Dhamma, and invitation of the Bahama Shampti to teach, consented to his invitation, and looking for people to teach.</p>\n<p>Note: * There is no mention of the seventh week, but the VP says \u201cThen, after staying at Uruvel\u0101 for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Benares (to teach the five group of ascetics).</p>\n<p>* However, popular Buddhist Tradition says that soon after his enlightenment, the Blessed One spent seven weeks near the river bank of Neranjana\u2014the place of enlightenment (now called Bodh Gaya): The seven weeks are described thus:</p>\n<p>First week: Under the Bodhi tree. Second week: The Buddha in gratitude to the Bodhi Tree for its support during his enlightenment, gazed at the bodhi tree. This is called \u2018animisa lochana puja\u2019. Following his example, the Buddhists pay respect to the Bodhi tree. Third week: Buddha saw in his mind that devas in the heavens were not sure of his Buddhahood, hence he created a golden bridge in the air and waled up and down. This is called \u2018Ruwan sakmana\u2019. Fourth Week: The Buddha created a beautiful jewelled chamber, sat inside it and meditate; six colours of rays\u2014blue, yellow, red, white, orange and mixture of the five colours.  ( it says each colour represents the noble qualities of the Blessed One: blue=confidence, yellow=holiness, red=wisdom, white= purity, orange=desire lessness and the mixed colour= representing all noble qualities of the Budda. Note: The Buddhist flag displayed by Buddhists during religious ceremonies represent all those colours). Fifth week: Meditating under the Banyan tree, encounter with the three daughters of M\u0101ra.  Sixth week: Meditating under the Midella tree, encounter with Muchalinda Naga. Seventh week: Sat under Rajayatana tree and meditate. After seven weeks of fasting the Buddha received a meal from Tapussa and Bhallika, two merchants. They became the first lay followers. (it says they asked the Buddha to give something to remind them of the Buddha and he gave a lock of his hair- Kesa Datu. The merchants returned home in Burma and made a chetiya called Shwedagon Pagoda (in Rangoon)  .</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Important Dhamma revealed during that period</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>The Cycle of Dependent Origination- Core Teaching of the Buddha</h3>\n<p>Vinaya Pitaka says: \u201csoon after his awakening the Buddha staying at the bodhi tree     experiencing the bliss of liberation from all suffering, was reflecting on Dependent Origination-DP (pat\u012btychcha samupp\u0101da) in forward and reverse order\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026ignorance is the condition for intentional activities; intentional activities are the condition for consciousness; consciousness is the condition for name and form \u2026 this is how there is the origin of this whole mass of suffering. \u2026 this is how there is the end of this whole mass of suffering\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>* In the following sutta we can see how the Blessed One shared his experience and knowledge of DP with his disciples:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cBhikkhus, before my enlightenment, while I was still a bodhisatta\u2026 it occurred to me: \u2018Alas, this world has fallen into trouble, in that it is born, ages, and dies, it passes away and is reborn, yet it does not understand the escape from this suffering [headed by] aging-and-death. When now will an escape be discerned from this suffering [headed by] aging-and-death?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026then, bhikkhus, it occurred to me: \u2018When what exists does aging-and-death come to be? By what is aging-and-death conditioned?  Then, bhikkhus, through careful attention, there took place in me a breakthrough by wisdom: \u2018When there is birth, aging-and-death comes to be; aging-and-death has birth as its condition.\u2019</p>\n<p>(meaning is that the penetration of aging-and-death occurred thus, \u201cWhen there is birth, aging-and-death comes to be)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In the same sutta we can see how the Buddha described that all factors of DP: ignorance\u2026etc depending on each other, originating the whole mass of suffering, and when those factors are not there how the suffering cessed. He was showing us how reflecting on this matter the full understanding came to him which led to his awakening:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cOrigination, origination\u2019\u2014thus, bhikkhus, in regard to things unheard before there arose in me vision, knowledge, wisdom, true knowledge, and light\u2026\u201d (cakkhu, \u00f1\u0101\u1e47a, pa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101, vijj\u0101, and \u0101loka)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cThus, with the remainder less fading away and cessation of ignorance comes cessation of volitional formations; with the cessation of volitional formations, cessation of consciousness\u2026. Such is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering. \u201c\u2018Cessation, cessation\u2019\u2014thus, bhikkhus, in regard to things unheard before there arose in me vision, knowledge, wisdom, true knowledge, and light.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Conditioned phenomena in DP above is described in the following sutta thus:</p>\n<pre>\n<p>When this exists that come to be</p>\n<p>With arising of this, that arise.</p>\n<p>When this does not exist, that does not come to be;</p>\n<p>with the cessation of this that ceases</p>\n<p>(imasmi.m sati ida.m hoti;</p>\n<p>imassuppaadaa ida.m uppajjati;</p>\n<p>imasmi.m asati ida.m na hoti;</p>\n<p>imassa nirodhaa ida.m nirujjhati)</p>\n</pre>\n<p>SN12: 49:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>12 Links of the Dependent Origination -Central Concept in Buddhism: Courtesy https://www.reddit.com/r/BuddhistMonastics/comments</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Note: * this is the first time Dependent Origination (DP) is mentioned in the scriptures (per Vinaya Pitaka)</p>\n<p>* In here, the Blessed One uttered his first 3 Udanas\u2019 (heartfelt exclamations) during his reflection on DP: A summary of the 3 Udanas:</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen things become clear to the energetic brahmin who practices absorption: then all his doubts are dispelled, since he understands the natural order and its conditions\u2026ssince he\u2019s understood the end of the conditions\u2026 he defeats the army of the Lord of Death, Like the sun beaming in the sky\u201d</p>\n<p>* Occasionally people who are studying suttas ponder: whether the Budhha\u2019s awakening happened while he was reflecting on DP as mentioned in Vinaya Pitaka?  or the real breakthrough happened on the full understanding of the Four Noble Truths as mentioned in his first discourse? (see: SN56: 11 ( Setting in Motion the Wheel of the Dhamma sutta). Here, what we have to point out is that the night of awakening as a \u2018Fully Enlighted One\u2019 \u2013 by himself through his great insight and deep wisdom, the Blessed One understood all the doctrines in the world. To stress this point we can look in to Sela Sutta (MN: 92) what the Buddha said to Brahamin Sela:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>What must be known is directly known,</p>\n<p>What must be developed has been developed,</p>\n<p>What must be abandoned has been abandoned,</p>\n<p>Therefore, brahmin, I am a Buddha.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cVery frequently, we find that the Buddha expressed His experience of enlightenment in one of two ways, either in terms of having understood the Four Noble Truths, or in terms of having understood the nature of dependent origination. Again, the Buddha has often mentioned that in order to attain enlightenment one has to understand the Four Noble Truths; or similarly, one has to understand dependent origination\u201d.</p>\n<p>Quote from http://www.buddhanet.net/funbud12.htm</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Who is an Arahant?</h3>\n<p>This also the very first time we see in the scriptures defining \u2018who is an arahant?\u2019</p>\n<p>When the newly enlightened Buddha was spending his blissful time around Bodh Gaya, a brahmin from nearby village approached him and inquired of the qualities of a brahmin. The Blessed One described the qualities showing that a real brahmin is not any ordinary brahmin but an arahant:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201c The brahmin who has shut out bad qualities, who is humble, free from flaws, and self-controlled, who has reached final knowledge and has fulfilled the spiritual life\u2014he may rightly proclaim himself a brahmin, having no conceit about anything in the world\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Arahant</p>\n<p>\u201cBhikkhus, \u2026 how is a bhikkhu an arahant? Evil unwholesome states that defile, bring renewal of being, give trouble, ripen in suffering, and lead to future birth, ageing, and death, are far away from him. That is how a bhikkhu is an arahant.\u201d</p>\n<p>( Katha\u00f1ca, bhikkhave, bhikkhu araha\u1e43 hoti? \u0100rak\u0101ssa honti p\u0101pak\u0101 akusal\u0101 dhamm\u0101, sa\u1e43kilesik\u0101, ponobbhavik\u0101, sadar\u0101, dukkhavip\u0101k\u0101, \u0101yati\u1e43, j\u0101tijar\u0101mara\u1e47iy\u0101.

Scriptures mentioned an encounter taken place at that time: a Naga King called Muchalinda, who had seen the Buddha in deep meditation during a heavy storm gave him protection by wrapping his body with his serpent-coils and putting his hood over the head. When the Buddha came out from the meditation and realising what the Naga King did uttered the following Udana showing the important of harmless practice towards all living beings.  This remind us of the Metta Sutta where the Buddha said that \u2018spreading loving kindness to all beings\u2019 is a quality important to tread on the Noble Path.</p>\n<pre>\n<p>\u201cSeclusion is bliss for the contented</p>\n<p>Who sees the Teaching that they have learned.</p>\n<p>Kindness to the world is happiness,</p>\n<p>For one who\u2019s harmless to living beings.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Dispassion for the world is happiness,</p>\n<p>For one who overcomes sensuality.</p>\n<p>But removing the conceit \u2018I am\u2019,</p>\n<p>This, indeed, is the highest bliss.\u201d</p>\n</pre>\n<p>Note: Apart from being harmless, in here we can see some other essential qualities supporting the spirituality such as seclusion, loving kindness (metta) to all, dispassion towards worldly things and abandon of conceit.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Muchalinda Naga giving protection to the Buddha</p>\n<p>12th century Naga-enthroned Buddha Cambodia.</p>\n<p>Picture courtesy: Cleveland Museum of Art: OH, USA.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>To Honour the Dhamma</h2>\n<p>On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Uruvel\u0101 on the bank of the river</p>\n<p>Nera\u00f1jar\u0101 at the foot of the Goatherd\u2019s Banyan Tree just after he had become fully enlightened a reflection arose in his mind thus:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cOne dwells in suffering if one is without reverence and deference. Now what ascetic or brahmin can I honour and respect and dwell in dependence on?... ... I do not see another ascetic or brahmin more perfect in the knowledge and vision of liberation than</p>\n<p>myself, whom I could honour and respect, and on whom I could dwell in dependence\u2026\u201cLet me then honour, respect, and dwell in dependence on this very Dhamma to which I have fully awakened.\u201d</p>\n<p>Note: * Spk assigns this sutta to the fifth week after the enlightenment. The sutta is also at AN II 20-21 with an additional paragraph, see: SN:Notes: 373, p. 550.</p>\n<p>* This shows the great wisdom and humility of the Buddha recognising the greatness of the Dhamma and sharing his experience with his disciples urging them to honour the Dhamma. This is a very important message to Buddhists- to understands the significant of the Dhamma- the teaching, he stressed this point on his last days of life conveying the important message \u2013 saying when the Buddha is no more \u2013 Dhamma will guide everyone. Hence, we Buddhist rely on Dhamma and live and practice according to Dhamma would never fall out from our spiritual path!, see: DN: 16 (Mahaparinibbana sutta)</p>\n<pre>\n<p>Dhamma should be revere</p>\n<p>Therefore, one desiring his own good,</p>\n<p>Aspiring for spiritual greatness,</p>\n<p>Should deeply revere the true Dhamma,</p>\n<p>Recollecting the Buddhas\u2019 Teaching</p>\n</pre>\n<p>Quote from: SN6:2</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Profundity of the Dhamma</h2>\n<p>Another significant Dhamma factor revealed during that time the Buddha was pondering of depth of the Dhamma he fathomed during the night of his awakening: understanding the causality (dependent origination) and giving up all attachments (abandoning greed -tanha) which led him to liberation. He reflected thus:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cI have discovered this profound truth, so hard to see, so hard to comprehend. It\u2019s peaceful and sublime, subtle, beyond the intellect, and knowable only to the wise\u2026\u201d  .</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Note: Following his reflection of the depth of the Dhamma, the Buddha felt that ordinary beings who are immersed in sensual pleasures would not be able to understand the realty and was hesitate to teach. This is what he thought:</p>\n<p></p>\n<pre>\n<p>\u2018Enough with teaching the Dhamma</p>\n<p>That even I found hard to reach;</p>\n<p>For it will never be perceived</p>\n<p>By those who live in lust and hate.</p>\n<p>Those dyed in lust, wrapped in darkness</p>\n<p>Will never discern this abstruse Dhamma</p>\n<p>Which goes against the worldly stream,</p>\n<p>Subtle, deep, and difficult to see\u201d</p>\n</pre>\n<p>MN: 26</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Buddha describes the event:</p>\n<p>\u201c \u2026then, bhikkhus, the Brahm\u0101 Sahampati knew with his mind the thought in my mind and he considered: \u2018The world will be lost, the world will perish, since the mind of the Tath\u0101gata, accomplished and fully enlightened, inclines to inaction rather than to teaching the Dhamma.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026then, just as quickly as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm, the Brahm\u0101 Sahampati vanished in the Brahma-world and appeared before me. He arranged his upper robe on one shoulder, and extending his hands in reverential salutation towards me, said:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cVenerable sir, let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma, let the Sublime One teach the Dhamma. There are beings with little dust in their eyes who are wasting through not hearing the Dhamma. There will be those who will understand the Dhamma -arise, victorious hero, caravan leader, Debtless one, and wander in the world. Let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma, there will be those who will understand.\u2019.</p>\n<p>MN:26.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Blessed One replied:</p>\n<p>\u201c \u2018Open for them are the doors to the Deathless, let those with ears now show their faith. Thinking it would be troublesome, O Brahm\u0101, I did not speak the Dhamma subtle and sublime\u2019\u2026 Then Brahma Shampati thinking: \u2018The Blessed One has consented to my request that he teach the Dhamma.\u2019 and after paying homage to me, keeping me on the right, he thereupon departed at once\u201d.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Note: * This is the first occasion Brahma Sahampati, follower of the Blessed One meeting the newly attained Buddha    * The Blessed One with great compassion consented to his request.</p>\n<p>* This incident demonstrates the Noble Qualities of the Buddha. He had the humility -modesty to accept the request of Brahma Sahampati to proclaim the Dhamma for the people who could get immense benefits from hearing the good Dhamma. He also displayed his highest wisdom by accepting a good advice.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Invitation of Brahma Shampati, picture courtesy: https://littledust.org/</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Significant events happened during that time</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h3>First Step towards the establishment of Fourfold Assembly</h3>\n<p>The Fourfold Assembly (catuparis\u0101 in Pali) denotes to the four groups who follow the Buddha\u2019s teaching:  monks, nuns and lay men and women. In the history of dispensation, of the Buddha, we can see that the first stone of the foundation of the Fourfold Sangha was laid during this time.  This is what happened. At that time, two brothers Tapussa and Bhallika, who were travelling from Ukkal\u0101 to Uruvela, near the place of enlightenment, on an advice of a deva, made some food offering to the Buddha. After offering the meal, they paid homage to the Buddha and asked him to accept them as lay followers  .</p>\n<p>Note: In the establishment of the dispensation, the Blessed One knowing the important of disciples of monks and nuns, also encouraged lay followers to be his disciples, for their own enhancement in spirituality and also to support monastic with four requisites which is essential for their survival. We can see that During the time of the Blessed One and after his passing away- up to the present time, due to the unwavering support of lay devotees, the dispensation of the Buddha still continues to grow and shine in the world!</p>\n<p>Tapussa and Bhallika, offering food to the Blessed One-Peshawar Museum: Picture courtesy: Wikipedia.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>First instance of the Devas\u2019 and non-humans paying homage</h2>\n<p>Often scriptures as well as legend bring stories on how devas or non-humans like Naga Kings paying homage to the Blessed One and asking question pertain to Dhamma and or listening to Dhamma discourses given by the Buddha. Earlier we saw how the Naga King Muchalinda paying homage to the Buddha. When the two brothers mentioned above wanted to offer food to the Buddha, the four great kings offered four alms bowls so the Blessed One could take his meal.  . We also witnessed how Brhmma Sahampati honouring the Blessed One and asking him to teach.  This is also a good example to confirm one of the noble qualities of the Buddha: \u2018teacher of humans and devas.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Note: * In this occasion it is mentioned that the Buddhas don\u2019t receive food with their hands, when the Blessed One was thinking of how to take the meal offered by Tapussa and Bhallika, the four great kings offered four crystal bowls. Tradition says through the psychic potency of the Buddha the four bowls became one. This was the first alms bowl Buddha carried * It is important to note that Deva\u2019s recognising Samma Sambuddha as a supreme being of the world and helping the dispensation to enhance.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>With this note we would like to conclude the section-4, pertain to the Enlightenment of the Buddha. In section 13: we will continue the story of Buddha from his first Teaching Tour, first discourse at the age of 35+ to his passing away at the age of 80, how he wandered in and around the \u2018middle country\u2019 of northern part of Jambudipa dedicating 45 years of his noble life teaching Dhamma and guiding people who wanted to be tamed towards freedom from suffering.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u25d9 Summary</p>\n<p>* In this section we saw how the bodhisatta, with his vigour and wisdom defeated M\u0101ra and his army won the supreme Buddha hood.</p>\n<p>* We have also mentioned the Noble qualities of a Fully Enlightened Budda to show why it is important of a Awaken Being to appear in the midst of population who have no knowledge of the true Dhamma.</p>\n<p>* Briefly we have touched the period soon after of the Buddhahood and learned the good Dhamma teaching the Blessed One shown to the world.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>End Notes: Section 4</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>[i] The exact date of Buddha's enlightenment is not precisely known, as it predates written records.  It is believed to have occurred in the 6th century BCE. The most widely accepted date is around 563 BCE to 483 BCE, although different Buddhist traditions may have slightly different calculations: https://www.quora.com/</p>\n<p>[ii] In this sutta the Buddha said: \u201cI considered: \u2018It is not easy to attain that pleasure with a body so excessively emaciated. Suppose I ate some solid food\u2014some boiled rice and porridge.\u2019 And I ate some solid food\u2014some boiled rice and porridge. Now at that time five bhikkhus were waiting upon me, thinking: \u2018If our recluse Gotama achieves some higher state, he will inform us.\u2019 But when I ate the boiled rice and porridge, the five bhikkhus were disgusted and left me, thinking: \u2018The recluse Gotama now lives luxuriously; he has given up his striving and reverted to luxury. See: MN: 36 ( Mah\u0101saccaka Sutta)</p>\n<p>[iii] The Group of five left the bodhisatta about the new moon day of Cita (April) and moved to Migadaya, the Deer Park. See: The Group of Five: The Great Chronicles of Buddhas by Venerable Mingun Sayadaw.</p>\n<p>[iv] This refers to the noble state of an arahant: see: AN1:41-50 & AN:6: 77.</p>\n<p>[v] AN5:196 (Dream sutta): see also notes regarding this: AN: Notes: 1200 & 1201.</p>\n<p>[vi] M\u0101ra is the Evil One of Buddhism, the Tempter and Lord of Sensuality bent on distracting aspirants from the path to liberation and keeping them trapped in the cycle of repeated birth and death. Sometimes the texts use the word \u201cM\u0101ra\u201d in a metaphorical sense, as representing the inward psychological causes of bondage such as craving and lust and the external things to which we become bound, particularly the five aggregates themselves. But it is evident that the thought world of the suttas does not conceive M\u0101ra only as a personification of humankind\u2019s moral frailty, but sees him as a real evil deity out to frustrate the efforts of those intent on winning the ultimate goal. The proof of this lies in his pursuit of the Buddha and the arahants after their enlightenment, which would not be credible if he were conceived of merely as a psychological projection.

We have selected a few extracts from the scriptures where the physical bodily qualities of the Blessed One were described:</p>\n<p>* <b>Discovery of Brahmin Student Uttara</b></p>\n<p>According to the Brahm\u0101yu Sutta (MN:91) the Brahm\u0101yu, sent his student Uttara to verify the report spread about the Buddha in his community as being true or not. He instructed his student to check all the noble qualities and also the so-called thirty-two physical marks attributed to the Buddha.

He approached the Buddha, exchanged greetings and sat down nearby and looked for the thirty-two marks of a Great Man on the Blessed One\u2019s body, seeing all of them except two. The Blessed One, knowing that doubt occurred in the mind of Sela, performed a feat of supernormal power so the brahmin Sela saw the missing two marks.

Repeatedly we see him engaged in living dialogue with people from the many different strata of ancient Indian society\u2014with kings and princes, with brahmins and ascetics, with simple villagers and erudite philosophers, with earnest seekers and vain disputants. It is perhaps in this scripture above all others that the Buddha emerges in the role ascribed to him in the canonical verse of homage to the Blessed One as \u201c<b><i>the </i></b><i>incomparable leader of persons to be tamed, the teacher of gods and humans</i>\u201d.<span id=\"Endnote2\">[<a href=\"#endnote2\">2</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>Bhikkhu Bodhi.</b></p>\n<p>The most extraordinary attributes of the Buddha as a Teacher were his boundless compassion, great humility and brilliant teaching methods. With those excellent qualities combined with his vast wisdom and psychic ability, the Blessed One was able to guide and transform innumerable humans as well as devas who approached him seeking solace and peace. In the scriptures there is much evidence that even members of other religious sects, though they were not inclined to follow his teaching, had respect for him and even paid tribute to him.</p>\n<p>We have selected a few events from Blessed One\u2019s teaching career to demonstrate this.</p>\n<p><u>The Blessed One taught the spiritual life,</u></p>\n<p><u>not based on tradition, culminating in nibb\u0101na,</u></p>\n<p><u>lived for the sake of</u></p>\n<p><u>restraint and abandoning.</u></p>\n<p><u>This is the path of the great beings,</u></p>\n<p><u>the path followed by the great seers.</u></p>\n<p><u>Those who practice it</u></p>\n<p><u>as taught by the Buddha,</u></p>\n<p><u>acting upon the Teacher/s guidance,</u></p>\n<p><u>will make an end of suffering.AN:25</u></p>\n<p><u>\u201cBhikkhus, this spiritual life is not lived for the sake of deceiving people and cajoling them; nor for the benefit of gain,</u></p>\n<p><u>honor, and praise; nor for the benefit of winning in debates; nor with the thought: \u2018Let the people know me thus.\u2019 But</u></p>\n<p><u>rather, this spiritual life is lived for the sake of restraint, abandoning, dispassion, and cessation AN25</u></p>\n<h2>\u25b2<b>The Buddha and the Brahmin Sundarika Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja:</b></h2>\n<p>On one occasion the Blessed One, with the simile of the cloth explained to the assembly of monks and lay people how the mind could become impure or pure. He said that when a person with a pure mind understands the Dhamma, he has the capability to liberate his mind and can be called \u2018<b><i>one bathed with the inner bathing\u2019.</i></b> Sitting in that assembly was Brahmin Sundarika Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja who believed in purification by ritual bathing. When the Buddha mentioned \u2018inner bathing\u2019, he became excited and asked:</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026<i>does Master Gotama go to the B\u0101huk\u0101 River to bathe?\u201d</i></p>\n<p>When the Buddha asked the reason for taking a bath in the B\u0101huk\u0101 River, he replied:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cMaster Gotama, the B\u0101huk\u0101 River is held by many to give liberation, it is held by many to give merit, and many wash away their evil actions in the B\u0101huk\u0101 River.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>Then the Blessed One said:</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>B\u0101huk\u0101 and Adhikakk\u0101, Gaya\u2026</i></p>\n<p><i>and the stream Bahumat\u012b,</i></p>\n<p><i>A fool may there forever bathe, </i></p>\n<p><i>Yet will not purify dark deeds.</i></p>\n<p><i>One pure in heart has evermore </i></p>\n<p><i>\u2026one fair in act, one pure in heart </i></p>\n<p><i>Brings his virtue to perfection.</i></p>\n<p><i>It is here, brahmin, that you should bathe,</i></p>\n<p><i>To make yourself a refuge for all beings. </i></p>\n<p><i>\u2026</i><i> </i><i>With faith and free from avarice, </i></p>\n<p><i>What need for you to go to Gay\u0101? </i></p>\n<p><i>For any well will be your Gay\u0101.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>The Brahmin Sundarika Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja understood the well-spoken and logical teaching of the Blessed One, saying:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cMagnificent, Master Gotama!

Master Gotama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways, as though he were turning upright what had been overthrown, revealing what was hidden, showing the way to one who was lost, or holding up a lamp in the dark for those with eyesight to see forms. I go to Master Gotama for refuge\u2026\u201d</i></p>\n<p>Sundarika Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja became a noble arahant in the Buddha\u2019s dispensation <span id=\"Endnote3\">[<a href=\"#endnote3\">3</a>]</span>.</p>\n<h2>\u25b2<b>The Buddha and the Wanderer M\u0101gandiya:</b></h2>\n<p>In M\u0101gandiya Sutta (MN:75) we can see the wanderer M\u0101gandiya a hedonist philosopher who was not approving of the Buddha, and was even disgusted to see the bed where the Blessed One slept, saying this to his friend who was hosting the Buddha in his dwelling <span id=\"Endnote4\">[<a href=\"#endnote4\">4</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\u201cThe recluse Gotama is a destroyer of growth.\u2019 Why is that? Because that has come down in our discourse.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>The Blessed One gave an opportunity to M\u0101gandiya to explain his views and ideas. The Buddha, then using clear parables and sound reasoning, broke Magandiya's views and vision of the sensual world, allowing him to understand the Dhamma. One of the similes the Buddha gave which helped M\u0101gandiya see things as they are\u2019 was:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cM\u0101gandiya, suppose there was a man born blind who could not see \u2026 He might hear a man with good eyesight saying: \u2018</i><b><i>Good indeed, sirs, is a white cloth, beautiful, spotless, and clean!</i></b><i>\u2019 and he would go in search of a white cloth. Then a man would cheat him with a dirty soiled garment \u2026 -and he would accept it and put it on, and being satisfied with it, he would utter words of satisfaction thus: \u2018Good indeed, sirs, is a white cloth, beautiful, spotless, and clean!\u2019 What do you think, M\u0101gandiya? When that man born blind accepted that dirty soiled garment, put it on, and being satisfied with it \u2026\u2014did he do so know and seeing, or out of faith in the man with good eyesight?\u201d</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>M\u0101gandiya said: <i>\u201c</i><i>Venerable sir, he would have done so unknowing and unseeing, out of faith in the man with good eyesight.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>The Buddha said:</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026so<i> too, M\u0101gandiya, the wanderers of other sects are blind and visionless. They do not know health, they do not see Nibb\u0101na, yet they utter this stanza thus: \u2018</i><b><i>The greatest of all gains is health, Nibb\u0101na is the greatest bliss.</i></b><i>\u201d</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>After listening to the discourse of the Buddha, faith was established in him and Magandia said:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cI have confidence in Master Gotama thus: \u2018Master Gotama is capable of teaching</i></p>\n<p><i>me the Dhamma in such a way that I can come to know health and to see Nibb\u0101na.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>So, we can see how the Buddha using apt similes and firm reasoning gave a wonderful teaching to Magandia who became a faithful disciple and a noble arahant.</p>\n<h2>\u25b2<b>The Buddha and Prince Abhaya</b></h2>\n<p>The following encounter occurred at Prince Abhaya\u2019s home. We can see again the Buddha\u2019s skilfulness as a teacher and his similes reveals his compassion for all beings.</p>\n<p>One time Prince Abhaya, one of the sons of King Bimbisara of Magadha <span id=\"Endnote5\">[<a href=\"#endnote5\">5</a>]</span>, who was a follower of Niga\u1e47\u1e6dha N\u0101taputta <span id=\"Endnote6\">[<a href=\"#endnote6\">6</a>]</span> was asked by his teacher to meet the Buddha and refute his doctrine. The method he suggested was to ask the Buddha whether he speaks words disagreeable to others, and if the Buddha agreed, then to ask what the difference was between him and ordinary people. If the Buddha replied that he would not utter speech that which would be disagreeable to others, then Prince Abaya would say to him:</p>\n<p><i>\u201c \u2026why have you declared that Devadatta is destined for a rebirth in lower realm? \u2026he is angry and displeased by your speech\u2026\u201d</i></p>\n<p>He said to Prince Abhaya, \u201cWhen the recluse Gotama is posed with this two-horned question by you, he will not be able either to throw it up or to gulp it down. (Suggesting that the prince could refute the Buddha that way).</p>\n<p>Following the advice of his teacher, Prince Abhaya invited the Blessed One to his home for a meal. After the meal he asked:</p>\n<p><i>\u201c</i><i>Venerable sir, would a Tath\u0101gata utter such speech as would be unwelcome and disagreeable to others?\u201d</i></p>\n<p>The Buddha replied: <i>\u201cThere is no one-sided answer to that, prince\u201d. </i></p>\n<p>Then the prince said, \u201c<i>Then, venerable sir, the Niga\u1e47\u1e6dhas have lost in this\u201d</i> <span id=\"Endnote7\">[<a href=\"#endnote7\">7</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>and proceeded to tell the Buddha about his conversation with his teacher.Ythe Buddha then asked:</p>\n<p><i>\u201c \u2026what do you think prince, this child (pointing to the son of the prince) were to put a pebble in his mouth, what would you do to him?\u201d</i></p>\n<p>The prince replied: \u201c<i>Venerable sir, I would take it out. If I could not take it out at once, I would take his head in my left hand, and crooking a finger of my right hand, I would take it out even if it meant drawing blood. Why is that? Because I have compassion for the child.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>Then The Blessed One explained:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1) that such speech\u2026to be untrue\u2026unbeneficial, and which is also \u2026disagreeable to others: such speech the Tath\u0101gata does not utter\u20262) speech knows to be true and correct but unbeneficial, \u2026and disagreeable to others: such speech the Tath\u0101gata does not utter\u20263) \u2026speech knows to be true, and beneficial, but which is disagreeable to others: the Tath\u0101gata knows the time to use such speech 4) \u2026speech\u2026knows to be untrue, and unbeneficial, but which is welcome and agreeable to others: such speech the Tath\u0101gata does not utter 5) \u2026 speech\u2026knows to be true but unbeneficial, and which is agreeable to others: such speech the Tath\u0101gata does not utter 6) \u2026speech as knows to be true and beneficial, and which is \u2026agreeable to others: the Tath\u0101gata knows the time to use such speech. Why is that? Because the Tath\u0101gata has compassion for beings.</p>\n<p>Then Prince Abhaya asked a further question:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cVenerable sir, when learned nobles\u2026and learned recluses, after formulating a question, then go to the Blessed One and pose it, has there already been in the Blessed One\u2019s mind the thought: \u2018If they come to me and ask me thus, I shall answer thus? Or does that answer occur to the Tath\u0101gata on the spot?\u201d</i></p>\n<p>Knowing that prince was skilled in chariots, the Buddha asked:</p>\n<p><i>\u201c</i><i>What do you think, prince? When people come to you and ask: \u2018What is the name of this part of the chariot?\u2019 has there already been in your mind the thought: \u2018If they come to me and ask me thus, I shall answer them thus\u2019? Or does that answer occur to you on the spot?</i>\u201d</p>\n<p>He replied: <i>\u201c</i><i>Venerable sir, I am well known as a charioteer skilled in the parts of a chariot. All the parts of a chariot are well known to me. That answer would occur to me on the spot.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>Then Buddha elaborated:</p>\n<p><i>\u201c</i><i>So too, prince, when learned nobles\u2026 learned recluses, after formulating a question, then come to the Tath\u0101gata and pose it, the answer occurs to the Tath\u0101gata on the spot. Why is that? That element of things has been fully penetrated by the Tath\u0101gata, through the full penetration of which the answer occurs to the Tath\u0101gata on the spot.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>After that day, Prince Abahya became an ardent follower of the Buddha and later became a disciple and a noble arahant <span id=\"Endnote8\">[<a href=\"#endnote8\">8</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>\u25b2The Buddha and the Wanderer Vacchagotta</b></p>\n<p>During the time of the Buddha views on the origin of the world, existence of a soul, and what happened after death were hotly debated and argued about.

The king could obtain release only by promising the demon that he would provide him daily with a human victim. First the king sent the criminals from the prison, but when there were no more prisoners, he required every family to provide a child. All the families with children eventually fled to other lands and it became incumbent on the king to offer his own son, the \u0100\u1e37avaka prince <span id=\"Endnote18\">[<a href=\"#endnote18\">18</a>]</span>. The Buddha, aware of the impending sacrifice, went to the yakkha\u2019s haunt on the day before the offering was to take place in order to convert the demon from his evil ways. At that time the yakka was attending a meeting in the Himalayas, but the Buddha entered his cave, sat down on the yakkha\u2019s throne, and preached the Dhamma to his ladies of his harem. When the yakkha heard about this, he hastened back to \u0100\u1e37av\u0131\u0304 in a fury and demanded that the Blessed One leave\u201d. <span id=\"Endnote19\">[<a href=\"#endnote19\">19</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><img src=\"page7/image3.jpeg\" /></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>Taming of \u0100\u1e37avaka Yakkha by the Blessed One</b>: Picture courtesy: https://namo.lk/category/tripitaka/sutta/samyuttanikaya/</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u0100lavaka the Yakkha arrived at his dwelling and seeing the Buddha sitting there, he said:</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>Get out, ascetic!</i>\u201d.</p>\n<p>The Buddha said: <i>\u201cAll right, friend,\u201d</i> and he went out,</p>\n<p>then the yakkha said: \u201c<i>Come in, ascetic</i>\u201d</p>\n<p>and the Blessed One came in.</p>\n<p>The Buddha complied with the yakkha\u2019s demands three times because he knew that compliance was the most effective way to soften his mind.

After her marriage, she moved into the home of her rich husband but her life with her wealthy relatives was not so comfortable as she had not given a large dowery to her in-laws. However, later when she gave a birth to a son her life became much easier as she had produced and heir for the family. The little baby son was her world. Tragically, one day, the little son fell ill and died and Kis\u0101 Gotam\u012b berft with sorrow could not accept the reality her son\u2019s death. She carried the dead child here and there asking for a good doctor to cure him.  Her mind had become deranged. One day, seeing the weeping and wailing wildly around, a kind villager pointed her to the Buddha who was living at the Jetavana monastery nearby, telling her that he was a great physician who could cure her son.</p>\n<p>She headed for the monastery and seeing saw the Blessed One, she put her at his</p>\n<p>feet begged him to help her son. The wise and compassionate Buddha saw the satate pf her mind and did not point out the obvious. Instead, in order to help her, he asked her to complete the task of bringing a few mustard seeds, from any household, the only cavet being that it had to be from a home that had known no death. She was so glad to hear that the Blessed One could help cure her son and set off, to the neighbouring village to obtain those mustard seeds.</p>\n<p>The family of the first house Kisagotami approached was happy to was happy to give her mustard seeds. Delighted she collected the seeds but stopped to check:</p>\n<p>\u201c <i>has anyone died in your house</i>\u201d.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, they said that their father had died recently in that house. Dismayed but not deterred, Kis\u0101gotam\u012b persisted, going from house to the next \u2014hoping to obtain those mustard seeds. She returned to the Buddha, not having found a single house in the village that had not known death.</p>\n<p>Finally, she understood why the Buddha had asked her to bring mustard seeds form a house where no one had died. It had nothing to do with the mustard seeds. She understood that everyone who was born had to die. She put her dead son in the cremation ground and went back to the Buddha.</p>\n<p>The Blessed One taught her the Dhamma\u2014the truth of reality. She renounced her lay life, became a bhikkhuni, practiced according to the Dhamma and became a disciple of the Blessed One.</p>\n<p>In SN:Bhikkhunisamyutrta we read the verse of Venerable Kis\u0101 Gotam\u012b the arahant, fearlessly facing M\u0101ra the evil on.</p>\n<p>M\u0101ra said:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cWhy now, when your son is dead, </i></p>\n<p><i>Do you sit alone with tearful face? </i></p>\n<p><i>Having entered the woods all alone, </i></p>\n<p><i>Are you on the lookout for a man?</i></p>\n<p>The bhikkhuni replied:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cI\u2019ve gotten past the death of sons; </i></p>\n<p><i>With this, the search for men has ended. </i></p>\n<p><i>I do not sorrow, I do not weep, </i></p>\n<p><i>Nor do I fear you, friend!\u201d</i></p>\n<p>Then M\u0101ra the Evil One, realizing, \u201cThe bhikkhun\u012b Kis\u0101gotam\u012b knows me,\u201d sad and disappointed, disappeared right there <span id=\"Endnote30\">[<a href=\"#endnote30\">30</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u2666 <b>Taming Angulim\u0101la -the Serial Killer </b><span id=\"Endnote31\">[<a href=\"#endnote31\">31</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>On one occasion the Blessed One was living at S\u0101vatth\u012b in Jeta\u2019s Grove, there was a serial killer named Angulim\u0101la lived in the thick forest grove of Kosala country. He was collecting 1000 fingers to make a garland for his teacher as an honorarium. At the time the sutta opens he was one short of a thousand and had decided to kill the next person to come along.</p>\n<p>The Buddha saw with his divine eye, that Angulim\u0101la\u2019s mother was on her way to visit her son. The Blessed One knowing that Angulim\u0101la had the supporting conditions for arahantship, intercepted him shortly before his mother was due to arrive. Matricide is one of the five terrible crimes that lead to immediate rebirth in hell. Thus, the Buddha with his universal compassion for both the mother and the son, interceded to prevent Angulim\u0101la from committing this crime. When Angulim\u0101la saw the Blessed One walking along on the forest path; he came running behind the Buddha, thinking to cut a finger to complete his finger garland. Then the Blessed One performed such a feat of supernormal power that the bandit Angulim\u0101la, though running as fast as he could, could not catch up with the Blessed One, who was walking at his normal pace. At that the bandit Angulim\u0101la thought:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cIt is wonderful, it is marvellous!

Often, he would explain a teaching in detail (vitth\u0101rena). Having introduced his topic with a short statement or synopsis (uddesa), he would then explain it at length (niddesa), analysing it, drawing out its implications, and sometimes attaching a simile (upam\u0101) to reinforce his point. Finally, he would restate the introductory declaration as a conclusion (niggamana), now supported by the entire weight of the foregoing analysis. On other occasions, however, the Buddha would not teach in detail. Instead, he would present the Dhamma briefly (sa\u1e45khittena), offering only a short, sometimes even cryptic, statement charged with profundity but meaning. The Buddha did not teach the Doctrine in this way in order to conceal an esoteric message. He used this technique because it sometimes proved more effective than a detailed elaboration in shaking and transforming the minds of his listeners.</p>\n<p>Although direct explanation of the meaning may have transmitted information more efficiently, the purpose of the teaching is not to convey information but to lead on\u2014 to insight, higher wisdom, and deliverance. By requiring the disciples to reflect upon the meaning and to draw out the implications by sustained inquiry and mutual discussion, the Buddha ensured that his utterance would serve this purpose\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p><b>Bhikkhu Bodhi</b> <span id=\"Endnote33\">[<a href=\"#endnote33\">33</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>\u2666The Blessed One Can Teach in Brief or in Detail</b></p>\n<p>The Buddha said:</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>S\u0101riputta, I can teach the Dhamma briefly; I can teach the Dhamma in detail; I can teach the Dhamma both briefly and in detail.

Through his power (<i>indriya paropariyatte \u00f1\u0101na</i>) <span id=\"Endnote35\">[<a href=\"#endnote35\">35</a>]</span> to see the maturity levels of the spiritual faculties of others he would choose the subject/s and expound accordingly.  If a person or persons would benefit form a detail discourse with parables and clear meaning then the Buddha would utter such teachings; if a person who has matured spiritual faculties, he would utter a brief Dhamma statement with deep a meaning. Both ways The Blessed One, with his great compassion wanted to help word-lings to understand the Dhamma for the sake of getting out of Samsara and to achieve liberation.</p>\n<p>Below we show the two styles of teachings of the Blessed One:</p>\n<p><b>Lengthy- Detailed Teachings of the Buddha</b></p>\n<p>\u2666 <b>With Subha the Brahmin Student</b> <span id=\"Endnote36\">[<a href=\"#endnote36\">36</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>One-time Subha the brahmin student approached the Blessed One and asked if there were  causes and conditions why humans are seen to be inferior and superior? \u2026for people are seen to be short-lived and long-lived, sickly and healthy, ugly and beautiful, uninfluential and influential, poor and wealthy, low-born and high-born, stupid and wise.</p>\n<p>The Buddha said:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cStudent, beings are owners of their ashoe ctions, heirs of their actions; they originate from their actions, are bound to their actions, have their actions as their refuge. It is action that distinguishes beings as inferior and superior\u201d</i></p>\n<p>Then the Buddha clarified the statement in detail:</p>\n<p>* <u>Reasons why people are seen to be short-lived or long-lived</u>:</p>\n<p>When a person kills and harms other beings, after passing away he will be born in a bad destination. However, if he were to be reborn in the human world, due to his previous bad actions he will have a short life, but if a person abandoned killing and harming other beings, live with compassion for others, after passing away he will be born in a good destination, but if he would be reborn in human world, due to his previous good actions he will have a long life.</p>\n<p>* <u>Reasons why people are seen to be sick or healthy</u>:</p>\n<p>When a person performed wounding others by hand or a weapon, because of his bad action, after passing away he will reborn in a bad destination, if he reappear in human world, due to his previous bad action he will suffer from bad health, but if a person avoids such bad actions and has compassion for others, after passing away would bereborn in a good destination; if he reappear in human world, due to his previous good action he will shave good health.</p>\n<p>* <u>Reasons for people are seen to be ugly or beautiful/handsome</u>:</p>\n<p>When a person is often angry and hostile in his life, and after passing away he appears in a bad destination, but if he reappear in human world he would be ugly.

One of the most often quoted teachings of the Buddha was addressed to the K\u0101l\u0101mas on an occasion when the the Blessed One was staying in Kesaputta:</p>\n<p>They approached the Buddha and said:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cBhante, there are some ascetics and brahmins who come to Kesaputta\u2026they explain their own doctrines, but denounce the doctrines of others\u2026 We are perplexed and in doubt, Bhante, as to which of these good ascetics speak truth and which speak falsehood\u201d</i></p>\n<p>The Buddha said:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cIt is fitting for you to be perplexed\u2026to be in doubt. Doubt has arisen in you about a perplexing matter. Come, K\u0101l\u0101mas, do not go by oral tradition, by lineage of teaching, by hearsay, by a collection of scriptures, by logical reasoning, by inferential reasoning, by reasoned cogitation, by the acceptance of a view after pondering it, by the seeming competence [of a speaker], or because you think: \u2018The ascetic is our guru\u2019. But when, K\u0101l\u0101mas, you know for yourselves: \u2018These things are unwholesome; these things are blameworthy; these things are censured by the wise; these things, if accepted and undertaken, lead to harm and suffering,\u2019 then you should abandon them\u201d.</i></p>\n<p>The Buddha then explained what was meant by unwholesome. Greed, hatred, and delusion he said were the three unwholesome roots which underlay all immoral conduct and all defiled states of mind. He then asked them:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cWhat do you think, K\u0101l\u0101mas? When greed arises in a person, is it for his welfare or for his harm?\u201d</i></p>\n<p>They replied: \u201c<i>For his harm, Bhante.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>The Buddha asked: <i>\u201cK\u0101l\u0101mas, a greedy person, overcome by greed, with mind obsessed by it, destroys life, takes what is not given, transgresses with another\u2019s wife, and speaks falsehood; and he encourages others to do likewise. Will that lead to his harm and suffering for a long time?\u201d</i></p>\n<p>They replied:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cYes, Bhante.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>This applied to the other unwholesome satates: hate and delusion. Then the Buddha extended his teaching to K\u0101l\u0101mas: describing the other two unwholesome: hate and delusion. He asked them once again whether they thought those things were  harmful and brought suffering and the K\u0101l\u0101mas\u2019 agreed that all unwholesome intentions being about  harm and suffering for a long time.</p>\n<p>Then the Blessed One said:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cThus, K\u0101l\u0101mas, when we said: \u2018Come, K\u0101l\u0101mas, do not go by oral tradition \u2026 But when you know for yourselves: \u201cThese things are unwholesome; these things are blameworthy; these things are censured by the wise; these things, if undertaken and practiced, lead to harm and suffering,\u201d then you should abandon them,\u2019 it is because of this that this was said\u201d</i></p>\n<p>The Blessed One continued his discourse and asked them whether non-greed, non-hate and non-delusion are for the benefit of a person, and they affirmed that all wholesome things bring happiness for a longtime to oneself and also to the others. The Buddha then described the benefit of wholesome actions and how the abandoning of unwholesome states leads to one\u2019s own liberation. In this way the Buddha directed the K\u0101l\u0101mas toward Dhamma\u2014<b>that abandoning all greed, hate and delusion is the way to nibbana</b>. By simply by letting them reflect on their own he taught them the Dhamma without their having to blindly believe him.</p>\n<p>At the end of the discourse the K\u0101l\u0101mas venerated the Blessed One and said:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cExcellent, Bhante! \u2026 We go for refuge to the Blessed One, to the Dhamma, and to the Sa\u1e45gha of bhikkhus.

He inquired regarding the Blessed One and the monks told him that the Buddha had gone to the city of S\u0101vatth\u012b on alms round. B\u0101hiya eagerly ran towards the city and saw the Blessed One, approached him, venerated him and asked the Buddha to teach him the Dhamma. Since, the Buddha had already entered the village for alms, he told B\u0101hiya that it was not the proper time to teach.  B\u0101hiya asked three times and each time the Buddha repeated his reply. Yet B\u0101hiya begged for Dhamma.</p>\n<p>The Buddha with his just then saw that B\u0101hiya\u2019s life span was  a very short one, and with great compassion taught him the Dhamma right then and there.</p>\n<p><i> \u201c\u2026 B\u0101hiya, you should train yourself thus: In what is seen there must be only what is seen, in what is heard there must be only what is heard, in what is sensed there must be only what is sensed, in what is cognized there must be only what is cognized.

Rebirth- previous lives is a central teaching in Buddhism; when someone passes away, he/she will have a rebirth according to actions (Kamma) they have performed in the present life.

The story goes like this: The King Pacetana was preparing for a forthcoming war and asked his chariot maker to make pair of wheels for the royal chariot. Then chariot maker began his work and it took him nearly six months to make only one wheel. The King came to see his work and, finding only one wheel was available, told him to hurry up as he was going into the battle in six days\u2019 time. The chariot maker agreed to make the second wheel within the next six days and finished his task. The king was puzzled about the two wheels, he could not see any difference of them. He asked what the difference was between the two wheels and the chariot maker demonstrated the difference of the two wheels this way: first he took the wheel made in six days and rolled it, it went a certain distance and then fell into the ground, however when he rolled the wheel made in six months, it rolled as far as it could go and then stood still on its axle. The king was amazed and wanted to know why the two wheels acted in two different ways. The chariot maker said thus:</p>\n<p><i>\u201c \u2018The wheel that took six days to finish, lord, has a rim \u2026 spokes \u2026 and a nave that is crooked, faulty, and defective.

The story was narrated by the Blessed One to show the Sangha, that who would succeed in the Dhamma Vinaya and who would not. Like the wheel made only in six days could not roll and stand still, Sangha who are not practicing well and are crooked in body, speech and mind will fall down, but the Sangha who are practicing well and without any crookedness in body, speech and mind will stand tall in the dispensation like the wheel made in six months<span id=\"Endnote23\">[<a href=\"#endnote23\">23</a>]</span>.</p>\n<p><b>\u2666 As King Makh\u0101deva of Mithil\u0101 and also as King Nimi </b><span id=\"Endnote24\">[<a href=\"#endnote24\">24</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Once the Blessed One was staying in Makh\u0101deva Mango Grove of Mithil\u0101, when in a certain place, he smiled.

He avoids womanizing, drunkenness, gambling and bad friends.\n\n\n\n\u25b2<b>Importance of Taking Care of Parents</b>\nThe Buddha often insisted, that people should take care of their parents. In this regard the Buddha pointed out two important things: 1) Providing material comforts to ones\u2019 parents 2) \n Supporting them to establish in Dhamma\u2014take refuge in the Triple Gem; guiding them into develop Right View, so they could attain the first level of spirituality\u2014 to be a stream winner.\nThe Blessed One did not just advise others about treating their parents with respect. The Buddha not only helped his own parents but also his stepmother, who had adopted him when he was young, to develop spiritually and to liberated from samsara suffering. We have discussed this is detail in section:2 of this compilation.\nFollowing are some details from the scriptures, elaborating the advices and guidance of the Buddha towards the welfare of one\u2019s parents:  \n\u2666 <b>Parents are the First Teachers of Children</b>\n<i>\u201c Mother and father are called \u2018Brahm\u0101\u2019 (great!)</i>\n<i>and also \u201cfirst teachers.\u201d </i>\n<i>They are worthy of gifts from their children, </i>\n<i>for they have compassion for their offspring.</i>\n<i>Therefore, a wise person should revere them, </i>\n<i>and show them due honor, </i>\n<i>serve them with food and drink, </i>\n<i>with clothes and bedding, </i>\n<i>by massaging and bathing them, </i>\n<i>and by washing their feet</i>\n<i>Because of this service </i>\n<i>to mother and father, </i>\n<i>the wise praise one in this world </i>\n<i>and after death one rejoices in heaven\u201d</i>----endnote6----\n\n\n\n\u2666 <b>Two Persons that Cannot Easily be Repaid </b>\nThe<b> </b>Buddha said that\u2019s to repay one\u2019s parents is hard. If they can establish them in spiritual life, then one is able to repay their parents. He said:\n<i>\u201c\u2026even if one were to establish one\u2019s parents as the supreme lords and rulers over this great earth abounding in the seven treasures, one still would not have done enough for one\u2019s parents, nor would one have repaid them. For what reason? Parents are of great help to their children; they bring them up, feed them, and show them the world\u2026 if, when one\u2019s parents lack faith, one establishes them in faith\u2026 in virtuous behaviour\u2026 in generosity; \u2026 in wisdom: in such a way, one has done enough for one\u2019s parents, repaid them, and done more than enough for them\u2026\u201d</i>----endnote7----\n\n\n\n\u201cThe wise person, dwelling at home,\ntruly lives for the good of many.\nDay and night diligent toward\nhis mother, father, and ancestors,\nhe venerates them in accordance with the Dhamma,\nrecollecting what they did for him in the past\u201d ----endnote8----\n\n\n\n<b>\u25b2 Important of Making Merits and Sharing them</b>\nAnother important advice given to lay followers were to make merits and share them with their departed relatives who are waiting to get merits from their relatives. Some of the advices of the Buddha in this matter are highlighted below:\n\u2666 <b>Merits is a Designation for Happiness</b>\nThe Buddha advised everyone (including his disciples) not to be afraid of making meris. In the following passage, he described how he had made merits which were beneficial to him for his many rebirths in samsara:----endnote9----\n\n\n\n<i>\u201c do not be afraid of merit. This is a designation for happiness, \u2026I recall that for a long time I experienced the desirable, lovely, agreeable result of merit that had been made over a long</i>\n<i>time. For seven years I developed a mind of loving-kindness. As a consequence, for seven eons of world-dissolution and evolution I did not come back to this world\u2026I fared on to the realm of streaming radiance. When the world was evolving there, I was Brahm\u0101\u2026 Sakka\u2026</i> <i>many hundreds of times I was a wheel-turning monarch\u2026\u201d</i>\nTherefore, one desiring the good,\naspiring for greatness,\nshould deeply revere the good Dhamma,\nrecollecting the Buddhas\u2019 teaching.\n\u2666 <b>More Benefits of Making Merits</b>\nIn the following sutta the Buddha pointed out <b>living in a suitable place</b> and <b>association with good friends </b>support a person to make merits which would bring him good fortune:\n \n<i>\u201c\u2026When a person dwells in a suitable locality </i>\n<i>and makes friends with the noble ones, </i>\n<i>when he has formed right resolutions, </i>\n<i>and done deeds of merit in the past, </i>\n<i>grain, riches, fame, and reputation, </i>\n<i>along with happiness accrue to him\u201d</i>----endnote10----\n\n\n\n\u2666 <b>Merits Supports Good Rebirths</b>\nIn the following sutta the Blessed One described how to make merits by giving gifts, food etc. to others such as virtuous persons, visitors, one going on a journey, to a sick person. The merits made in this life bring happiness for the present life and also for lives in the other world ----endnote11----\n\n\n\n<i>Therefore, with a non-regressing mind, </i>\n<i>one should give a gift where it yields great fruit. </i>\n<i>Merits are the support of living beings </i>\n<i>when they arise in the other world\u2026\u201d</i>\n* When Suppav\u0101s\u0101, Koliyan daughter ----endnote12----, gave food to the Buddha and the Sangha, the Buddha praised her and said that her generosity would bring good fortune:----endnote13----\n\n\n\n<i>\u201c\u2026those recollecting such generosity </i>\n<i>dwell in the world inspired by joy. </i>\n<i>Having removed the stain of miserliness and its root, blameless, </i>\n<i>they go to the heavenly abode\u201d</i>\n<b><i>*</i></b><b> </b>In the following sutta the Buddha said that there are three bases of meritorious activity and they bring good rebirths. \nWhat three? The basis of meritorious activity consisting in giving; the basis of meritorious activity consisting in virtuous behaviour; and the basis of meritorious activity consisting in\nmeditative development. Even if one practice these three bases in <b>average way,</b> he will be reborn among humans in a favourable condition. If someone practice\u2026 in <b>superior way</b> he will be reborn in Deva realms.----endnote14----\n\n\n\n\u2666 <b>Sharing Merits (</b><b><i>punna</i></b><b>) with Departed Relatives</b>\nIn Buddhist culture sharing merits of good deeds is a common feature. In the scriptures we can see many instances where the Buddha advising people to give merits to their departed relatives.\n* On one occasion when King Bimbisara offered the 1<sup>st</sup> monastery to the Buddha and the sangha, he accrued much merits. Tradition says that during that occasion some of his relatives from former life waited to receive merits but failing appeared in a dream. The King had been disturbed by the bad dream inquired form the Buddha about it. The Blessed One with his supernormal powers understood that the former relatives in Petha realm were waiting for merits. Hence, the king gave food and other requestees to the Buddha and sangha and shared merits with his former relatives. Because of given merits they rejoiced and been released from their woeful status.----endnote15----   Afterwards, the Blessed one gave a discourse to the king regarding importance of sharing merits with departed relatives thus:\n\u201c They stand beyond the walls,\nand at the junctions and crossroads,\nthey stand at the door-posts,\nhaving come to their\u00a0former\u00a0homes.\nBut when abundant food and drink,\nboth staple and non-staple, is prepared,\nno one remembers these\nbeings, because of their\u00a0past unwholesome\u00a0deeds,\nThus, those who are compassionate\ngive to their\u00a0departed\u00a0relatives,\nat the right time, pure, excellent,\nsuitable drink and food.\nThinking: \"May this go to our relatives,\nmay our relatives be happy!\"\nThose who have gathered,\nthe departed relatives who have assembled\naround the food and drink,\nrespectfully offer their thanks:\nsaying: \" May our relatives live long!\nThose to whom we owe this gain,\nfor we have been honoured,\nthose who give are not without reward!\" ----endnote16--------endnote17----\n\n\n\n*  The following sutta also highlights the importance of offering merits to the departed relatives.\nOn one occasion Brahmin J\u0101\u1e47usso\u1e47\u012b ----endnote18---- approached the Blessed One and asked: \n<i>\u201cMaster Gotama, we brahmins give gifts and perform the memorial rites for the dead with the thought: \u2018let our gift be of benefit to our departed relatives\u2026 let our departed relatives partake of our gift\u2026can our gift, actually be of benefit to our departed relatives?\u201d</i>\nBuddha, then gave detailed description of departed beings who had taken rebirth in a certain realm, who could benefit from such offerings. The Blessed One also pointed out that it is impossible to say that in this long samsara journey, our relatives and friends were not born in unfortunate places where they were waiting to get merits from their relatives. The Buddha concluded by saying that there are beings who can benefit from alms given in memory of the dead. Likewise, people who offer such alms also receive much merit. Brahmin J\u0101\u1e47usso\u1e47\u012b, understood the teaching said:\n\u201c<i>It\u2019s astounding and amazing, Master Gotama, that there is reason to give gifts and perform the memorial rites for the dead, since for the donor too it is not fruitless\u201d.</i>----endnote19----\n\n\n\n<b>\u25b2 How to Take Food in order to Maintain Good Health</b>.\nThe Buddha has advised his followers how to partake their meals so they can have a good digest which help for healthy life. He also often pointed out that healthy body would support to develop meditation.\n\u201cWhen a man is always mindful ...\nKnowing moderation in the food he eats\nHis ailments then diminish: \nHe ages slowly, guarding his life\u201d ----endnote20----\n\n\n\n<b>\u25b2How Buddhists Should Dwell in Home Life</b>\nOften in scriptures we can see the Buddha advising lay flowers to be generous towards monks, nuns and other ascetics who need support to maintain their spiritual life, and to support family and relatives, poor and beggars who need food, clothing etc. He also encouraged them to develop meditation, especially recollections (anusati bhavana) of the Triple Gem, their generosity and virtue, higher queitites of Deva etc. Following suttas elaborate this point.\n\u2666  On one occasion Mahanama the Sakyan approached the Buddha as asked: how should one dwell in lay life with various duties and engagements etc. Then the Blessed One showed him the way: To be successful in homelife one must have faith, energy, mindfulness, stillness of mind and wisdom. Then one must develop further 6 things: 1-3 recollection of the qualities of Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha (anusati ). To recollect one\u2019s own: 4 virtue, 5 generosity &amp; 6 qualities of Devas. ----endnote21----\n\nNote: Details of anusati bhavana are given in the above suttas.\n\n\n\n\u25b2 <b>Keeping Precepts Brings Happiness in this Life and Favourable Rebirth.</b> \nThe Buddha has shown his men and women lay followers the importance of observing the Five Precepts on daily basis and the Eight Precepts on Uposatha days.----endnote22----\n\nFollowing is some of the suttas carrying this message:\n\u2666 <b>Keeping five precepts</b>\nThe following sutta points out the benefits of keeping five precepts.\nThe Buddha said:\n\u201cThere are\u2026 these five gifts, great gifts, primal, of long standing, traditional, ancient, unadulterated and never before adulterated\u2026not repudiated by wise ascetics and brahmins. What five? ----endnote23----\n\n1) <b>abstain from destruction of life</b>2) \u2013 5) abstain from: <b>taking what is not given</b>\u2026<b>from sexual misconduct\u2026from false speech</b>\u2026 <b>from liquor, wine, and intoxicants. </b>- this gives to an immeasurable number of beings freedom from fear, enmity, and affliction. He himself enjoys freedom from fear, enmity, and affliction. Keeping these precepts led a person to be happy in this life and to gain a good rebirth.\n\u2666 <b>Keeping eight precepts</b>\nOne should not kill living beings or take what is not given;\none should not speak falsehood or drink intoxicants;\none should refrain from sexual activity, from unchastity;\none should not eat at night or at an improper time.\nOne should not wear garlands or apply scents;\none should sleep on a low bed or a mat on the ground;\nthis, they say, is the eight-factored uposatha\nproclaimed by the Buddha,\nwho reached the end of suffering.\nWhatever wealth exists in this sphere\u2014\npearls, gems, and excellent beryl,\nhorn gold and mountain gold\u2026\nthose are not worth a sixteenth part\nof an uposatha complete in the eight factors\u2026\nTherefore, a virtuous woman or man,\nhaving observed the uposatha complete in eight factors\nand having made merit productive of happiness,\nblameless goes to a heavenly state----endnote24----\n\n\n\n<b>\u25b2Generosity</b>\nThe Buddha constantly praised almsgiving and pointed out to laypeople the benefits of giving alms to the ascetics, gifts to the people in need, sick people etc.\n* In the following sutta the Buddha pointed out how a good person should give gifts:\n(1) He gives what is pure; (2) he gives what<b> </b>is excellent; (3) he gives a timely gift; (4) he gives what is allowable; (5) he gives after investigation; (6) he gives often; (7)<b> </b>while giving he settles his mind in confidence; and (8) having given, he rejoiced ----endnote25----\n\n\t\n\n\tHe gives what is pure and excellent,\nallowable drinks and food at the proper time;\nhe gives gifts often to fertile fields of merit,\nto those who lead the spiritual life.\nHe does not feel regret,\nhaving given away many material things.\nThose with deep insight praise\nthe gifts given in this way.\nHaving thus practiced charity\nwith a mind freely generous,\none intelligent and wise, rich in faith,\nis reborn in a pleasant, unafflicted world ----endnote26----\n\n\t\n\n\tFaith, moral shame, and wholesome giving\nare qualities pursued by the good person;\nfor this, they say, is the divine path\nby which one goes to the world of the devas ----endnote27----\n\n\n\n<b>\u25b2 How to be Free from Suffering</b>\n On one occasion Bhadraka the headman approached the Buddha and said:\n<i>\u201cIt would be good, venerable sir, if the Blessed One would teach me about the origin and the passing away of suffering\u2026\u201d</i>\nThe Buddha used the method of dialogue to teach Dhamma to so Bhadraka could himself realise how the suffering come to be and how it passes away:\n<b>Buddha</b>: <i>\u201cWhat do you think, headman? are there any people in Uruvelakappa on whose account sorrow\u2026 pain\u2026would arise in you if they were to be executed, imprisoned\u2026 or censured?\u201d</i>\n<b>Bhadraka</b>: \u201c<i>There are such people, venerable sir.\u201d</i>\n<b>Buddha: </b><i>\u201cBut are there any people in Uruvelakappa on whose account sorrow\u2026 pain, \u2026would not arise in you in such an event?</i>\n<b>Bhadraka</b>: \u201c<i>There are such people, venerable sir.\u201d</i>\n<b>Buddha: </b><i>What\u2026is the cause and reason why in relation to some people \u2026sorrow, and pain, arise in you if they were to be executed\u2026while in regard to others no such sorrow\u2026 pain, would arise in you?</i>\n<b>Bhadraka</b>: <i>\u201cThose people\u2026 in in relation to whom sorrow\u2026pain, would arise in me if they were to be executed\u2026these are the ones for whom I have \u2026attachment\u2026\u201d</i>\nThen the Blessed One said:\n<i>\u201c\u2026whatever suffering arose in the past\u2026whatever suffering will arise in the future, all that will arise rooted in desire, with desire as its source; for desire is the root of suffering.\u2019</i>\n<i>\u201cIn this way too, headman, it can be understood: \u2018Whatever suffering arises, all that arises rooted indesire, with desire as its source; for desire is the root of suffering.\u2019\u201d</i>\nIn this way the Buddha showed Bhadraka, how to identify causes of suffering and to abandon it in order to lead be free and peaceful ----endnote28----\n\n\n\n<b>\u25b2 How to Recognize Good and Wise Person</b>\nOne of the advices that the Buddha consistently gave to his devotees was to associate with wise people and not with foolish people. The opening stanza of the Mangala Sutta is:\n\"Not associating with fools,\nwith the wise associating\u2026\nhonouring that worthy of honour:\nthis is a supreme blessing\u201d----endnote29----\n\n\n\n\u2666 <b>How to Recognize Wise People</b>\n*The following was the advice given to King Pasenadi of Kosala:\n<i>\u201c It is </i><b><i>by living together</i></b><i> with someone, great king, that his </i><b><i>virtue</i></b><i> is to be known, \u2026it is by </i><b><i>dealing with someone</i></b><i>, great king, that his </i><b><i>honesty </i></b><i>is to be known\u2026</i> <i>it is in </i><b><i>misfortunes</i></b><i>, great king, that a person\u2019s </i><b><i>strength</i></b><i>  is to be known\u2026</i> <i>It is by </i><b><i>discussion with someon</i></b><i>e, great king, that his </i><b><i>wisdom </i></b><i>is to be known\u2026 and that after a long time, not after a short time; by one who is attentive, not by one who is inattentive; by one who is wise, not by a fool\u2026\u201d</i>\n\u201cA man is not easily known by outward form \nNor should one trust a quick appraisal, \nFor in the guise of the well-controlled \nUncontrolled men move in this world.\n\u201cLike a counterfeit earring made of clay, \nLike a bronze half-penny coated with gold, \nSome move about in disguise: \nInwardly impure, outwardly beautiful ----endnote30----\n\n\n\n* The Buddha has shown the criteria to identify a fool and a wise person.\nIf a person has three bad qualities \u2014 bodily misconduct, verbal misconduct, and mental misconduct he is considered to be a fool, association of such people bring harm to ones\u2019 ordinary life as well as spiritual life.
