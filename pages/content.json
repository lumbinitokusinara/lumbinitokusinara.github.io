Although the Tipitaka does not mention the details of the time of the Buddha's birth, according to South East Asian tradition it is accepted that the Buddha Gotama was born in 623 B.C. on the full moon day of the month of May (Ves\u0101kha -Vesak)  .

The significance of a Buddha in a human realm is that an enlightened being, a teacher who can guide people through suffering and discontent to the ultimate goal of Nibb\u0101na   , becomes available to humankind. The following extract from the scriptures focus on the significance of the birth of the Buddha:</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026 there is one person who arises in the world for the welfare of many people, for the happiness of many people, out of compassion for the world, for the good, welfare, and happiness of devas and human beings \u2026  Who is that one person?

She felt herself being carried away by four devas to Lake Anotatta in the Himalayas. After bathing her in the lake, the devas clothed her in heavenly cloths, anointed her with perfumes, and bedecked her with divine flowers. Soon after a white elephant, holding a white lotus flower in its trunk, appeared and went round her three times, entering her womb through her right side\u201d.</p>\n<p>Quote from: https://www.buddhanet.net</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Queen Maya\u2019s dream- 2nd century Gandharan Sculpture.

The Bodhisatta\u2019s mother gave birth to him standing up\u2026when the Bodhisatta came forth from</p>\n<p>his mother\u2019s womb, he did not touch the earth.  The four young gods received him and set him before his mother saying: \u2018Rejoice, O queen, a son of great power has been born to you\u2026\u2019 then a great immeasurable light surpassing the splendour of the gods appeared in the world\u2019\u201d</p>\n<h3>Utterance at the Birth</h3>\n<p>Scriptures say that as soon as the Bodhisatta was born, he stood firmly with his feet, and walked seven steps facing north; a whit a white parasol held over him, he surveyed each quarter and uttered:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cI am the highest in the world; I am the best in the world;</p>\n<p>I am the foremost in the world. This is my last birth;</p>\n<p>now there is no renewal of being for me.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Bodhisatta taking seven steps by Sri Lankan artist M.

The Seer Asita  , witnessing the celebration of Devas, asked the reason for the celebration. Then Devas replied thus:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cThe being intent on awakening, a peerless gem, has been born in the human realm for the sake of their welfare and happiness, in Lumbin\u012b, a village in the Sakyan land. That\u2019s why we\u2019re so happy and in such excellent spirits. He is supreme among all beings, the best of people, chief of men, supreme among all creatures. He will roll forth the wheel in the grove of the seers, roaring like a mighty lion, lord of beasts.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Sakka the king of devas and his retinue rejoicing the birth of the Bodhisatta, Picture Courtesy: https://budusarana.lk/</p>\n<p>(need permission?)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Lumbini Park is the Place of Birth of the Gotama Buddha</h2>\n<p>In the Nepalese language \u2018Lumbini\u2019 means lovely. Tradition as well as also scriptures say that Lumbini, the Buddha\u2019s birth place was located in the Sakyan Kingdom of North India (called Middle Country). Above we saw a verse sung by the devas rejoicing of the birth of the Buddha thus:</p>\n<p>\u201cThe being intent on awakening, a peerless gem, has been born in the human realm for the sake of welfare and happiness, in Lumbin\u012b, a village in the Sakyan land\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>In the Pabbaja sutta of Suttanipata, replying to an inquiry by King Bimbisara of Magadha about his birth, the ascetic Siddhartha said this:</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u2018Up north, O King, on the slopes of the Himalayas,</p>\n<p>full of wealth and strength, lies the land</p>\n<p>of one whose abode is among the Kosalans.</p>\n<p>Their clan is named for the Sun,</p>\n<p>they are Sakyans by birth.</p>\n<p>I have gone forth from that family\u2014\u201d  .</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>The modern map of India (above) indicates that Lumbini is located in Nepal, near the border of India.  During the Buddha\u2019s life, the Indian subcontinent, including now Nepal, was known as Jambud\u020bpa. According to Buddhist scriptures, the Blessed One\u2019s native place was called, Kapilavattu, the royal capital of the Sakyans, hence Lumbini is believed to have been located near the royal capital of Kapilavattu. Previously we saw the statement of Ascetic Siddhartha to King Bimbisara that he was from the Sakyan country, situated on the slopes of the Himalaya Mountain range  . In the map below we can see that Kapilavattu is located below the Himalaya range.</h3>\n<p>Map showing the main provinces of North India during the time of the Buddha</p>\n<p>Source: Buddhist India by T.

Rhys Davids.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Evidence from Historical Sources of Lumbini as the Birth Place of the Buddha</h2>\n<h3>Asoka Pillar</h3>\n<p>According to history and archaeology, the first evidence from non-scriptural sources came through the discovery of an ancient pillar called the \u2018Asoka Pillar at Lumbini\u2019 built by the emperor Asoka. It seems that the King Asoka who became a follower of the Buddha, went on a pilgrimage to discover Buddhist sites around 248 B.C. (3rd century). When he visited Lumbini park, he built the monument as a mark of respect to the Buddha.</p>\n<p>The discovery of the Asoka Pillar in Lumbini   in 1896 was an important finding. In the Mah\u0101 Parinibb\u0101na Sutta (DN:16), the place where the Buddha was born is mentioned as one of the four places suitable for devoted Buddhist to visit and remember the greatest qualities of the Blessed One.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Inscriptions on the Asoka Piller</p>\n<p>Dev\u0101na\u1e43piyena Piyadasina l\u0101jina v\u012bsati-vas\u0101bhisitena- atana \u0101g\u0101ca mah\u012byite hida Budhe j\u0101te Sakyamuni ti- sil\u0101 viga\u1e0dabh\u012b c\u0101 k\u0101l\u0101pita sil\u0101-thabhe ca usap\u0101pite- hida Bhagava\u1e43 j\u0101te ti Lu\u1e43mini-g\u0101me ubalike ka\u1e6de  a\u1e6dha-bh\u0101giye ca.</p>\n<p>Source: wikipedia.org/</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The translation:</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen King Devanampriya Priyadarsin had been anointed twenty years, he came himself and worshipped (this spot) because the Buddha Shakyamuni was born here.

They were on a pilgrimage from China to India visiting ancient Buddhist sites. These two famous travellers from the Far East who visited Lumbini and many other important Buddhist palaces, recorded their travel encounters which later supported the archaeologists and other interested parties in locating the birth place of the Buddha and other similar sites.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Below: Ancient site of Lumbini, before the new constructions: Picture courtesy: UNESCO World Heritage Convention</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Below: Modern day Lumbini Park: picture courtesy: 1. World History Encyclopedia</p>\n<p>2 Dreamstime.com.</p>\n<h2>The Buddha was from Sakyan Clan</h2>\n<p>Numerous places in the scriptures point out that the Buddha belonged to the Sakyan clan, hence he was called \u2018Sakya Muni\u2019 (sage of Sakyan) and his disciples were called \u2018Sakya Putta\u2019 (son of Sakyans). The Sakyan\u2019s Republic was on the edge of the Himalayas and Kapilavattu was their royal capital. The Sakyan Republic was subject to the King of Kosala. Tradition as well as scriptures say that King Okkaka was the forefather of the Sakyan clan. In Amba\u1e6d\u1e6dha Sutta (DN:3), we can see a passage related to this:</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>The Buddha said thus:</h3>\n<p>\u201c\u2026for the Sakyans regard King Okk\u0101ka as their ancestor. At one time King Okk\u0101ka,  to whom his queen was dear and beloved, wishing to transfer the kingdom to her son, banished his elder brothers from the kingdom \u2014 made their home on the flank of the Him\u0101layas beside a lotus-pond where there was a big grove of teak-trees\u2026Then King Okk\u0101ka asked his ministers and counsellors: \u2018Where are the princes living now?\u2019 and they told him. At this King Okk\u0101ha exclaimed: \u201cThey are strong as teak (s\u0101ka), these princes, they are real Sakyans!\u201d \u2026and that is how the Sakyans got their well-known name. And the King was the ancestor of the Sakyans\u2026\u2019</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Sakyan (called khattiya) were rulers and considered to be proud people. During the Buddha\u2019s time there were four classes: Brahmins who served as priests and scholars, Kshatriyas were warriors who were kings and rulers; Vaishyas were merchants and traders and; Shudras were labourers\u2019 and servants. Some of the attributes given to Sakyan are given below:</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>* \u201cThe khattiya is the best among people for those whose standard is the clan\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>* \u201c\u2026aim of khattiyas; their quest is for wisdom; their support is power; they are intent on territory; and their final goal is sovereignty.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Tradition says that Kapilavattu had been named in honour of the sage Kapila. When the banished princes of King Okk\u0101ka, went to the Himalayan range searching for a place to live, they saw the hermitage of sage Kapila, who welcomed them and helped them to settle down near his hermitage. Later when they resorted to their own royal status, they built a city and named it Kapilavattu to show their gratitude to sage Kapila</h3>\n<p></p>\n<h3>In Mah\u00e2pad\u0101na Sutta (DN:14) there is a passage where the devas\u2019 mention that the city of Kapilavatthu is the native place of the Buddha:</h3>\n<p>\u201c\u2026in this fortunate aeon now, the Lord Buddha has arisen in the world\u2026 his father is King Suddhodana, his mother was Queen Maya, and his royal capital is Kapilavattu\u2026\u201d.</p>\n<h3>According to Mah\u0101parinibb\u0101na sutta (DN:16): When the Buddha passed away, the Sakyans from Kapilavatthu demanded relics of the Buddha thus:</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026the Sakyas of Kapilavattu heard (Parinibbana of the Buddha), and they sent a message: \u2018The Lord was the chief of our clan. We are worthy to receive a share of the Lord\u2019s remains, and we will make a great stupa for them\u2026 the Sakyans of Kapilavattu built one (stupa) at Kapilavattu\u201d.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Location of Kapilavattu</h2>\n<p>The map below shows the modern locations of Kapilavattu 1) site is in present day Nepal and the 2) site in Piprahawa of India.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>During the life of the Buddha, Kapilavattu was a well-known city in the northern part of Jambudvipa- now called the Indian sub-continent. The Sakyan Mah\u0101n\u0101ma a prominent member of Sakya clan, said this:</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026 this Kapilavatthu is rich and prosperous, populous, crowded, with congested thoroughfares. In the evening, when I am entering Kapilavatthu after visiting the Blessed One or the bhikkhus worthy of esteem, I come across a stray elephant, a stray horse, a stray chariot, a stray cart, a stray man (roaming excitedly) \u2026\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>According to tradition as well as scriptures it is said that Kapilavattu was destroyed by King Vidudabha, son of late king Pasenadi Kosala   .</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>* Ruins of that city, the native place of the Buddha were discovered not long ago during the time of British India (1858-1947); archeologists found two possible sites, near the Nepal-Indian border, one in Nepal and the other in India. The site in Nepal is called Tilaurakot located in present day Kapilavattu District, and the other site is Piprahwa, a village near Siddharthnagar, in state of Uttar Pradesh, India  .</p>\n<p>The controversy over the exact location of Kapilavattu is still unresolved. The map (above) shows that the two sites are not very far from each other (about 27 km apart) and are both close to, Lumbini, where prince Siddhartha was born.  Below are the pictures of the two sites:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Below: Stupa at Piprahwa village in Uttar Pradesh, India: picture courtesy: Wikipedia</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The east gate at the Tilaurakot archaeological site in Nepal: picture courtesy: Wikipedia</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u25d9 Summery</p>\n<p>In this section we have briefly described the birth of Gotama Buddha and significant events occurred during that time.</p>\n<p>* Buddha Gotama was born in 623 B.C. as a sakyan prince @ Lumbini Park of Sakyan province. Parents were King Suddhodana and Queen Mahamaya from the royal capital Kapilavattu</p>\n<p>* Why Appearance of the Buddha in the world is a unique event? Because he found the lost path to the liberation and shared his knowledge and experience with other beings who were benefited from his teachings.</p>\n<p>* According to scriptures Lumbini is one of the four holy place for Buddhist pilgrims (recommended by the Blessed One in DN:16 (Mahaprainibbana sutta). Seen the birth place of the Buddha would helps devotees to strengthen their faith, to inspire the urgency of releasing from samsara suffering. They would remember how the Blessed One urged his followers to be diligent and make haste to achieve liberation.</p>\n<p>*There are archeological and historical evidence to prove the birth of our Buddha Gotama was occurred at Lumbini.</p>\n<p>* Due to archeological evidence, there are 2 sites found as the Royal capital of Kapilavattu.

The Nepalese authorities dug around the pillar, to find the ancient Brahmi   inscription, which therefore had</p>\n<p>remained underground, hidden from view.

Some of the most significant pieces of Dhamma will be discussed here.</p>\n<p>The way the Buddha paid special attention to the spiritual growth of his congregation\u2014the Sangha\u2014is something that can be seen throughout the Tripitaka admonishing them at appropriate times, showing them the ropes of the spiritual life without leaving anything out and guiding them with compassion towards liberation from worldly suffering. It was a unique and admirable quality of a great spiritual leader.</p>\n<p>The best evidence of this is that even today, some 2,560 years after the Buddha\u2019s great Parinibbana, the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One is still practiced properly by his monastic disciples and the Dhamma is flourishing in the present-day world!</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Freedom to Follow</h2>\n<p>The methods and techniques used by the Buddha in guiding and training his disciples are wonderful. One of the most striking features is the freedom of entry into and exit from the</p>\n<p>Monastic order. We can see throughout the Buddha\u2019s dispensation; that his disciples have taken the monastic vows of their own free will. The Buddha has shown that his teachings are \u2018ehipassika\u2019\u2014 come and see\u2014so the disciples are free to follow or disrobe! Many of the early disciples of the Buddha\u2019s order were students of other religious leaders, or people who followed other philosophies or views. In most cases, they have seen the Blessed One, heard the Dhamma, become inspired by his wisdom and compassion and thus established faith in him. Similarly, if someone is not interested in living the monastic life or does not have the strength to continue, there is no obstacle to disrobe and return to lay life. However, for the welfare of other students, the Buddha has advised that proper steps should be taken to remove those who do not behave in accordance with Vinaya rules.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Buddha Teaching monks: Picture courtesy Gettyimages</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>To Follow the Middle Way\u2014The Noble Eightfold Path</h2>\n<p>The Buddha often expressed to the Sangha his own experience in seeking the truth\u2014an escape from worldly suffering.  As a prince from royal family, he had all the pleasures of the world (see: section 1 & 2) so he understood how sensuality bonds a person to the worldly life. Then as an ascetic, he practiced extreme austere practices thinking it would lead him to</p>\n<p>Enlightenment. Finally, through his wisdom and effort he achieved freedom from suffering (see Sections 3 & 4). Hence, the Blessed One advised his disciples: not to be indulge in sensual pleasures, nor follow extreme practices that torment the body which will lead to a disturb mind. The following extracts from scriptures, show us the importance of the middle path.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026bhikkhus, \u2026I strove indefatigably\u2026 \u2018willingly, let only my skin, sinews, and bones remain, and let the flesh and blood dry up in my body, but I will not relax my energy so long as I have not attained what can be attained by manly strength, energy, and exertion.\u2019 It was by heedfulness that I achieved enlightenment, bhikkhus; it was by heedfulness that I achieved the unsurpassed security from bondage\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Then he encouraged the Middle way:</p>\n<p>\u201cBhikkhus, these two extremes should not be followed by one who has gone forth into homelessness. What two? The pursuit of sensual happiness in sensual pleasures, which is low, vulgar, the way of worldlings, ignoble, unbeneficial; and the pursuit of self-mortification, which is painful, ignoble, unbeneficial. Without veering towards either of these extremes, the Tath\u0101gata has awakened to the middle way, which gives rise to vision, which gives rise to knowledge, which leads to peace, to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibb\u0101na\u2026\u201d .</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cEnamoured with their pleasures and wealth,</p>\n<p>Greedy, dazed by sensual pleasures,</p>\n<p>They do not realize they have gone too far</p>\n<p>Like deer that enter the trap laid out.</p>\n<p>Quote from: SN: 3:6.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Picture Courtesy: https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/dhammacakkappavattana-sutta</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Importance of Meditation Practice\u2014Samadhi</h2>\n<p>Here we would like to present the following quote from Bhikkhu Bodhi regarding why meditation is important for spiritual development.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cThe methods of meditation taught by the Buddha in the Pali Canon fall into two broad systems. One is the development of serenity (samatha), which aims at concentration (sam\u0101dhi); the other is the development of insight (vipassan\u0101), which aims at understanding or wisdom (pa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101). In the Buddha\u2019s system of mental training the role of serenity is subordinated to that of insight because the latter is the crucial instrument needed to uproot the ignorance at the bottom of sa\u1e41s\u0101ric bondage. The attainments possible through serenity meditation were known to Indian contemplatives long before the advent of the Buddha. The Buddha himself mastered the two highest stages under his early teachers but found that, on their own, they only led to higher planes of rebirth, not to genuine enlightenment (MN 26.15\u201316). However, because the unification of mind induced by the practice of concentration contributes to clear understanding, the Buddha incorporated the techniques of serenity meditation and the resulting levels of absorption into his own system, treating them as a foundation and preparation for insight and as a \u201cpleasant abiding here and now\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Quote from Bhikkhu Bodhi (MN: Introduction)</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Commending Meditation</h3>\n<p>In his teaching the Blessed One often pointed out that Samadhi and wisdom go hand in hand. Therefore, he emphasised meditation and urged the Sangha to meditate and achieve stillness of the mind. He often pointed out that the final liberation cannot be perceived by those who are immersed in lust, hate and delusion. Rather, through deep meditation all desires could be abandoned and freedom achieved.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Picture courtesy: https://declutterthemind.com/</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Meditation is Important for Spiritual Enhancement</h3>\n<p>In the following sutta we can further see how the Blessed One pointed out the importance of meditation\u2014Samadhi\u2014stillness of mind for spiritual growth.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026bhikkhus, the safe and good path to be travelled joyfully has been reopened by me, the wrong path has been closed off, the decoy removed, the dummy destroyed\u2026what should be done for his disciples out of compassion by a teacher who seeks their welfare and has compassion for them, that I have done for you, bhikkhus. There are these roots of trees, these empty huts. Meditate, bhikkhus, do not delay or else you will regret it later. This is our instruction to you.\u201d .</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Importance of Samadhi and wisdom for spiritual development</p>\n<p>There is no samadhi in one who lacks wisdom,</p>\n<p>nor is there wisdom in him who lacks samadhi.</p>\n<p>In whom are both samadhi and wisdom,</p>\n<p>he is in the presence of nibb\u0101na.</p>\n<p>Dhp: 372.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Meditation is the Direct Path to Eliminate Suffering</h3>\n<p>In MN:10 ( Satipa\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101na Sutta) and DN:22 (Mah\u0101 Satipa\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101na Sutta) the Buddha pointed out to his disciples that the four foundations of mindfulness meditation would guide them towards the breakthrough:</p>\n<p>\u201cBhikkhus, this is the direct path for the purification of beings, for the surmounting of sorrow and lamentation, for the disappearance of pain and grief, for the attainment of the true way, for the realisation of Nibb\u0101na\u2014namely, the four foundations of mindfulness\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Deep Meditation\u2014Attainment of Jh\u0101nas Blindfolds M\u0101ra</h3>\n<p>The following extract shows how the Buddha urged the Sangha to attain samadhi\u2014deep meditation in order to overcome all evil:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cSuppose a forest deer is wandering in the forest wilds: he walks\u2026 stands\u2026sits\u2026 lies down confidently. Why is that? Because he is out of the hunter\u2019s range. So too, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the first jh\u0101na\u2026 second jh\u0101na\u2026 third jh\u0101na\u2026 fourth jh\u0101na\u2026This bhikkhu is said to have blindfolded M\u0101ra, to have become invisible to the Evil One by depriving M\u0101ra\u2019s eye of its opportunity\u201d.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Meditation Brings Five Kinds of Knowledge</h3>\n<p>The Buddha said when a bhikkhu/bhikkhuni being alert and mindful, develops samadhi</p>\n<p>which is measureless (appam\u0101\u1e47anm), then five kinds of knowledge arise:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026.five kinds of knowledge arise that are personally yours. What five? (1) The knowledge arises that is personally yours: \u2018This samadhi is presently pleasant and in the future has a pleasant result.\u2019 (2) \u2026This samadhi is noble and spiritual.\u2019 (3) \u2026This samadhi is not practiced by low persons.\u2019 (4) \u2026This samadhi is peaceful and sublime, gained by full tranquilization, and attained to unification; it is not reined in and checked by forcefully suppressing (5) \u2026\u2018I enter this mindfully and I emerge from it mindfully.\u2019</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Note: the measureless samadhi is gaining the four divine abodes (brahmavih\u0101ra). In some places it is described as the destruction of greed, hatred, and delusion (See: AN: Notes: 992)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Buddha advising nuns: picture courtesy: https://www.finalonline.store/?path=page/ggitem&ggpid=273255</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>The Way to Recognize what is the Teaching of the Buddha</h2>\n<p>In the following suttas the Blessed One taught his disciples how to recognize the true Dhamma\u2014the teaching of the Buddha which would guide them to avoid any pitfalls while walking on the spiritual path.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>The Buddha Taught Eight Criteria to Recognise the True Dhamma\u2014 his Teachings</h3>\n<p>The following was addressed to bhikkhuni Maha Prajapati Gotami (formerly Buddha\u2019s step mother):</p>\n<p>\u201cGotam\u012b, those things of which you might know: \u2018These things lead (1) to passion, not to dispassion; (2) to bondage, not to detachment; (3) to building up, not to dismantling; (4) to strong desires, not to fewness of desires; (5) to non-contentment, not to contentment; (6) to company, not to solitude; (7) to laziness, not to the arousing of energy; (8) to being difficult to support, not to being easy to support,\u2019 you should definitely recognize: \u2018This is not the Dhamma; this is not the discipline; this is not the teaching of the Teacher.\u2019 But, Gotam\u012b, those things of which you might know: \u2018These things lead (1) to dispassion, not to passion; (2) to detachment, not to bondage; (3) to dismantling, not to building up; (4) to fewness of desires, not to strong desires; (5) to contentment, not to non-contentment; (6) to solitude, not [281] to company; (7) to the arousing of energy, not to laziness; (8) to being easy to support, not to being difficult to support,\u2019 you should definitely recognize: \u2018This is the Dhamma; this is the discipline; this is the teaching of the Teacher\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>* In the following sutta the Blessed One also showed Venerable Upali the way to recognise the True Dhamma:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cUp\u0101li, those things which you might know thus: \u2018These things do not lead exclusively to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to peace, to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to nibb\u0101na,\u2019 you should definitely recognize: \u2018This is not the Dhamma; this is not the discipline; this is not the teaching of the Teacher.\u2019 But those things which you might know thus: \u2018These things lead exclusively to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to peace, to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to nibb\u0101na,\u2019 you should definitely recognize: \u2018This is the Dhamma; this is the discipline; this is the teaching of the Teacher.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Full Understanding of Vital Factors Leads to Spiritual Development</h2>\n<p>Often the Blessed One advised his disciples to gain full understanding of sensuality, form and feelings. When one understands them properly\u2014as it is\u2014the reality of uselessness of them would surface. So, when one understood them fully, one is able to be free from suffering. The following sutta elaborates on this point:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>* On one occasion, a number of bhikkhus on their way for alms met wanderer of the other sects who said to them:</p>\n<p>\u201cFriends, the recluse Gotama describes the full understanding of sensual pleasures\u2026 material form\u2026 feelings, and we do so too. What then is the distinction here, friends, what is the variance, what is the difference between the recluse Gotama\u2019s teaching of the Dhamma and ours, between his instructions and ours?\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Then the Bhikkhus approached the Buddha and described their encounter with the wanderer of the other sect. The Buddha explained:</p>\n<p>\u201cBhikkhus, wanderers of other sects who speak thus should be questioned thus: \u2018But, friends, what is the gratification, what is the danger, and what is the escape in the case of sensual pleasures?... material form? feelings?\u2019 being questioned thus, wanderers of other sects will fail to account for the matter\u2026why is that? because it is not their province\u2026 those recluses\u2026who do not understand as it actually is the gratification as gratification, the danger as danger, and the escape as escape in the case of sensual pleasures\u2026material form \u2026feelings, can either themselves fully understand feelings or instruct another so that he can fully understand feelings\u2014that is impossible\u2026 but  those recluses\u2026 who understand as it actually is the gratification as gratification, the danger as danger, and the escape as escape \u2026can either themselves fully understand \u2026 or instruct another so that he can fully understand (them) \u2014that is possible.\u201d</p>\n<p>Note: In this sutta the Blessed One gave a detail description of the gratification, the danger, and how to escape from them.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>* In MN: 26 (Ariyapariyesan\u0101 Sutta)  the Blessed One advised his disciples how to be free from sensual pleasures:</p>\n<p>\u201cas to those recluses\u2026 who are not tied to these five cords of sensual pleasure, who are not infatuated with them or utterly committed to them, and who use them seeing the danger in them and understanding the escape from them, it may be understood of them: \u2018They have not met with calamity, not met with disaster, the Evil One cannot do with them as he likes.\u2019</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>To Guide and Train his Disciples the Buddha Used Four Methods</h2>\n<p>In the following sutta the Blessed One describes the way he trains and guides his disciples:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026I discipline one kind of person gently, another kind sternly, and still another kind both gently and sternly\u2026 (1) the gentle method: \u2018Such is bodily good conduct, such the result of bodily good conduct; such is verbal good conduct, such the result of verbal good conduct; such is mental good conduct, such the result of mental good conduct; such are the devas, such are human beings.\u2019 (2) the stern method: \u2018Such is bodily misconduct, such the result of bodily misconduct; such is verbal misconduct, such the result of verbal misconduct; such is mental misconduct, such the result of mental misconduct; such is hell, such the animal realm, such the sphere of afflicted spirits\u2026 (3) the gentle and stern method: \u2018Such is bodily good conduct, such the result of bodily good conduct; such is bodily misconduct, such the result of bodily misconduct. Such is verbal good conduct, such the result of verbal good conduct; such is verbal misconduct, such the result of verbal misconduct. Such is mental good conduct, such the result of mental good conduct; such is mental misconduct, such the result of mental misconduct. Such are the devas, such are human beings; such is hell, such the animal realm, such the sphere of afflicted spirits\u2026 (4) \u201cIf a person to be tamed by me won\u2019t submit to discipline by any of these methods, then I kill him.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Then Kesi, the horse trainer to whom the discourse was given asked:</p>\n<p>\u201cBut, Bhante, it isn\u2019t allowable for the Blessed One to destroy life. Yet he says, \u2018Then I kill him.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>The Buddha said: \u201cIt is true, Kesi, that it isn\u2019t allowable for the Tath\u0101gata to destroy life. However, when a person to be tamed won\u2019t submit to discipline by the gentle method, the stern method, or the method that is both gentle and stern, then the Tath\u0101gata thinks he should not be spoken to and instructed, and his wise fellow monks, too, think he should not be spoken to and instructed. For this, Kesi, is \u2018killing\u2019 in the Noble One\u2019s discipline: the Tath\u0101gata thinks one should not be spoken to and instructed, and one\u2019s wise fellow monks, too, think one should not be spoken to and instructed.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Qualities to be Developed by the Sangha to be Worthy</h2>\n<p>Time and again the Blessed One instructed his disciples to develop good qualities worthy of the Sangha. In the following suttas we can see how the Buddha admonished his monastics.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>How to be Worthy- by Having Four Qualities</h3>\n<p>The Buddha said:</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026bhikkhus, possessing four qualities a bhikkhu is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world. What four? Rectitude, speed, patience, and mildness. Possessing these four factors, a bhikkhu is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>* In the following sutta the Buddha says to his disciples how to develop some other 4 qualities:</p>\n<p>\u201cHere, a bhikkhu is one who listens, who destroys, who patiently endures, and who goes\u2026how a bhikkhu listen: when the Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tath\u0101gata is being taught, a bhikkhu heeds it, attends to it, directs his whole mind to and listens with eager ears\u2026 how a bhikkhu destroys: does not tolerate an arisen sensual thought\u2026 arisen thought of ill will \u2026 an arisen thought of harming \u2026 any other bad unwholesome states that arise from time to time, but abandons them, dispels them, terminates them, and obliterates them\u2026 how a bhikkhu endure: patiently endures cold and heat; hunger and thirst; contact with flies, mosquitoes, wind, the burning sun, and serpents; rude and offensive ways of speech; he is able to bear up with arisen bodily feelings that are painful, racking, sharp, piercing, harrowing, disagreeable, sapping one\u2019s vitality\u2026 how a bhikkhu is one who goes: quuickly goes to that region where he has never before gone in this long stretch of time, that is, to the stilling of all activities, the relinquishment of all acquisitions, the destruction of craving, dispassion, cessation, nibbana\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>How to be Skilful in Actions</h2>\n<p>The Blessed One often advised his disciples to be skilful in their actions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>In the \u2018Metta sutta\u2019 (Karaniya metta sutta) the Buddha described qualities to be developed by one who is skilled in goodness and who wanted to walk the Path of Peace and achieve freedom. A summary of the qualities to be skilful is given below:</h3>\n<p>1) Able- sakko (capable in carrying out tasks relevant to the spiritual life) 2) Upright- uj\u016bca (not wavering on following precepts with proper conduct) 3) Straight - suhuj\u016bca (to be frank and honest) 4) Obedient -S\u016bvaco (accepting and accommodating) 5) Gentle -mudu (soft in ways)  6) Humble- anatim\u0101n\u012b (modest not conceited) 7) Contentment- santussako (satisfied with whatever they receive as the four requisites) 8) Easily satisfied- subharo ca ( easy to support, not burdensome to others) 9) Not busy- appakicco ( having few duties, unbusy, unburdened by too many duties)  10) Frugal- sallahukavutt\u012b (thrifty living simply)</p>\n<p>11) Controlled senses- restrain- santindriyo (not letting one\u2019s senses go all around)</p>\n<p>12) Wise and skilful -nipako (have wisdom to understand Dhamma and be prudent) 13) Not proud- appagabbho (modest and not harsh) 14) Not demanding and attached to families -kulesu ananugiddho (not much association with lay people) 15) Not doing unwise-unskilful things that the wise people would reprove- na ca khudda\u1e43 sam\u0101care ki\u00f1ci,Yena vi\u00f1\u00f1\u016b pare upavadeyyu\u1e43) 16) Having loving kindness towards all beings (sukhino v\u0101 khemino hontu,</p>\n<p>Sabbe satt\u0101 bhavantu sukhitatt\u0101) 17) Not deceiving, hating, or harming  others with anger - Na paro para\u1e43 nikubbetha,-N\u0101tima\u00f1\u00f1etha katthaci na\u1e43 ka\u00f1ci;-By\u0101rosan\u0101 pa\u1e6dighasa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101,</p>\n<p>N\u0101\u00f1\u00f1ama\u00f1\u00f1assa dukkhamiccheyya. 18) Spreading loving kindness to all beings - metta\u00f1ca sabba lokasmi\u1e43,19) Having Right view- di\u1e6d\u1e6dhi\u00f1ca anupagamma, S\u012blav\u0101 dassanena sampanno.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Harmful Actions should be Avoided and Beneficial Actions should be Carried Out</h3>\n<p>Over and over again the Blessed One advised the Sangha to be mindful and reflect on any action before it is done, while it is being done and after it is completed.  The following suttas illustrate this matter</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Four Deeds to be Reflected upon Carefully</h3>\n<p>\u201c\u2026there are these 4 deeds: 1) disagreeable and harmful: one considers that this deed should not be done on both grounds: because it is disagreeable to do and because it will prove harmful. One considers that this deed should not be done on both grounds. 2) disagreeable to do but proves beneficial: one can understand who is a fool and who is a wise person in regard to manly strength, manly energy, and manly exertion. The fool does not reflect thus: \u2018Although this deed is disagreeable to do, still it will prove beneficial\u2026 so he does not do that deed, and his refraining from it proves harmful. But the wise person does reflect thus: \u2018Although this deed is disagreeable to do, still it will prove beneficial.\u2019 3) agreeable to do which will prove harmful: that one can understand who is a fool and who is a wise person in regard to manly strength, manly energy, and manly exertion. The fool does not reflect thus: \u2018Although this deed is agreeable to do, still it will prove harmful.\u2019 so he does that deed, and it proves harmful. But the wise person does reflect thus: \u2018Although this deed is agreeable to do, still it will prove harmful.\u2019 So he does not do that deed, and his refraining from it proves beneficial\u2026 4) agreeable to do which will prove beneficial: this deed is considered one that should be done on both grounds: because it is agreeable to do and because it proves beneficial. This deed is considered one that should be done on both grounds\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Guarding Three Doors Prevents Unskilful Actions</h3>\n<p>In MN: 61 (Ambala\u1e6d\u1e6dhik\u0101r\u0101hulov\u0101da Sutta) the Buddha admonished Venerable R\u0101hula thus:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026 an action with the body\u2026 speech \u2026 mind should be done after repeated reflection\u2026 \u2018Would this action that I wish to do with the body lead to my own affliction, or to the affliction of others, or to the affliction of both? is it an unwholesome\u2026action with painful consequences, with painful results?\u2019 When you reflect, if you know: \u2018This action that I wish to do\u2026 would lead to my own affliction, or to the affliction of others, or to the affliction of both; it is an unwholesome \u2026 action with painful consequences, with painful results,\u2019 then you definitely should not do such an action with \u2026but when you reflect, if you know: \u2018This action that I wish to do\u2026would not lead to my own affliction, or to the affliction of others, or to the affliction of both; it is a wholesome\u2026action with pleasant consequences, with pleasant  results,\u2019 then you may do such an action\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>When Doing Deeds, one should Practice Heedfulness</h3>\n<p>The Blessed One said thus:</p>\n<p>\u201cBhikkhus, there are four occasions when heedfulness should be practiced\u2026 (1) \u201cabandon bodily misconduct and develop bodily good conduct; do not be heedless in this. (2) Abandon verbal misconduct and develop verbal good conduct; do not be heedless in this. (3) Abandon mental misconduct and develop mental good conduct; do not be heedless in this. (4) Abandon wrong view and develop right view; do not be heedless in this\u2026when a bhikkhu has abandoned\u2026 misconduct and developed\u2026 good conduct; has abandoned wrong view and developed right view, then he need not fear death in the future.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Restraint is Good</p>\n<p>Good is restraint in the eye; good is restraint in the ear;</p>\n<p>good is restraint in the nose; good is restraint in the tongue.</p>\n<p>Good is restraint in deed; good is restraint in speech;</p>\n<p>good is restraint in mind; good is restraint in everything.</p>\n<p>The monk, restrained at all points, is freed from sorrow.</p>\n<p>Dpa:361.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>How Guard the Spiritual Life</h2>\n<p>As a skilful teacher the Blessed One often shows the Sangha how to sidestep things that would obstruct spiritual development. Often, we see in scriptures how the Sangha gets into dangers while not paying attention to the teaching and training:</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>The Four Perils that would Lead to Abandoning the training</h3>\n<p>The Buddha advised the Sangha that there are four dangers for one who enters the homeless life under his Dispensation. Those who can overcome these four fears will become established in the Dispensation. The others will not become established.</p>\n<p>The following suttas give details of the four dangers to be faced in spiritual development:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Here, the spiritual life is compared to entering a body of water\u2014there are four kinds of fears to be expected for one who goes down to the water: fear of waves, fear of crocodiles, fear of whirlpools, and fear of sharks. Likewise, there are four dangers to be expected to a person who have gone forth: 1) Not pleased with the instructions on training\u2026  it is like a strong wave comes and takes one in to the deep sea 2) Not pleased with the food \u2026it is like a crocodile comes and drags one and eats him 3) Not restraining the sense faculties\u2026it is like being caught by the whirlpool and drowned 4) Getting involved or attracted to the opposite sex\u2026it is like a shark comes and devours one.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cThese, bhikkhus, are the four perils to be expected for a clansman who has gone forth out of faith from the household life into homelessness in this Dhamma and discipline\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>That monk who dwells in the Dhamma,</p>\n<p>who delights in the Dhamma,</p>\n<p>who meditates on the Dhamma,</p>\n<p>who well remembers the Dhamma,</p>\n<p>does not fall away from the sublime Dhamma.</p>\n<p>Dhp:364.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>How to Grow in the Dhamma and Discipline</h2>\n<p>The Buddha pointed out eleven ways to be capable of growth in the spiritual life. An extract summary from the suttas is given below:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu possesses these eleven qualities, he is capable of growth, increase, and fulfilment in this Dhamma and Discipline\u201d</p>\n<p>1) possesses a full knowledge of the material form2) understands the difference between a wise person and a fool 3) is able to remove all unwholesome actions arising due to sensual desires, ill will and cruelty 4) restrains the six faculties in order not to be tempted by them 5) teaches the Dhamma to others in order to master them 6) visits learned sangha who are well versed in the Dhamma to clarify questions and doubts 7) gains inspiration by hearing the Dhamma 8) understands and practices the Noble Eightfold Path 9) understands and practices the Four Foundations of Mindfulness 10) restrains oneself in receiving the four requisites 11) pays respect and homage to leaders and elder sangha of longstanding in the dispensation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>* In this sutta the Blessed One points out factors that would support the growth of the spiritual path:</p>\n<p>\u201c It is possible, \u0100nanda, that a bhikkhu endowed with  faith\u2026virtue\u2026 much learning\u2026 easy to correct\u2026 has good friends\u2026 energy\u2026 mindfulness\u2026 contentment\u2026few desires\u2026and hold right view will achieve growth, progress, and maturity in this Dhamma and discipline\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>To be in a Complete Spiritual Life.</h2>\n<p>Here the Blessed One advises the Sangha to abandon five factors and to develop five factors in order to consummate the holy life.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cWhen sensual desire and ill will,</p>\n<p>dullness and drowsiness, restlessness,</p>\n<p>and doubt are totally absent in a bhikkhu;</p>\n<p>when one like this possesses</p>\n<p>the virtue and samadhi</p>\n<p>of one beyond training.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>and [similar] liberation and knowledge;</p>\n<p>possessing five factors</p>\n<p>and having removed five factors,</p>\n<p>he is truly called a consummate one</p>\n<p>in this Dhamma and discipline.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Note: The Five factors to abandon are the five hinderances (sensual desire, ill will, dullness & drowsiness, restlessness & remorse and doubt), to possess five factors of one beyond training (asekha dhamma- qualities of an arahant- the consummate one): virtue, samadhi, wisdom, liberation, knowledge and vision.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Skilful in Understanding One\u2019s own Mind</h2>\n<p>The Blessed One repeatedly advised the Sangha to be skilful in one\u2019s own mind. The Buddha says:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cBhikkhus, a bhikkhu who is not skilled in the ways of others\u2019 minds [should train]: \u2018I will be skilled in the ways of my own mind.\u2019 It is in this way that you should train yourselves\u2026 and how is a bhikkhu skilled in the ways of his own mind? It is just as if a woman or a man\u2026.fond of ornaments\u2014would look at her or his own facial reflection in a clean bright mirror or in a bowl of clear water. If they see any dust or blemish there, they will make an effort to remove it. But if they do not see any dust or blemish there, they will be glad about it; and their wish fulfilled, they will think, \u2018How fortunate that I\u2019m clean!\u20192060 examination is very helpful for a bhikkhu [to grow] in wholesome qualities.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Note: To be an expert of one\u2019s own mind there are ten things to be reflect on:  whether I have</p>\n<p>1) desire or not 2) ill will or not 3) dullness and laziness or not 4) restlessness and remorse or not 5) doubt or not 6) anger or not 7) defilements or not 8) bodily  agitatation  or not 9) laziness or energy 10) samadhi or not.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Protectors of the Spiritual Path</h2>\n<p>Time and again the Blessed One instructed the Sangha to continue one\u2019s spiritual life under a protector.  In the following suttas the Buddha expounded ten things that would protect the spiritual path:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cBhikkhus, live under a protector, not without a protector. One without a protector lives in suffering. There are these ten qualities that serve as a protector\u2026( n\u0101thakara\u1e47\u0101 dhamm\u0101.)\u201d</p>\n<p>The 10 protectors:</p>\n<p>1) to dwell in good conduct and resort, seeing danger in minute faults 2) to learn much and retain what has been learned 3) associate with good dhamma friends 4) to be easy to correct and obey teaching instructions with respect 5) skilful in spiritual life and supporting the fellow monastics in diverse duties 6) to love the Dhamma and  enjoy it 7) to have energy to abandon the unwholesome and to arouse wholesome qualities 8) to have contentment in material things 9) to have sound mindfulness 10) to have wisdom to understand arising and passing away which leads to the destruction of suffering  .</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Engage in Subjects Suitable for Discussion</h2>\n<p>The Blessed One regularly admonished the Sangha to refrain from idle talk, empty talk and chatter and to engage in noble silence. He advised the Sangha thus:</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026It is fitting for you clansmen who have gone forth out of faith from the home life into homelessness to sit together to discuss the Dhamma. When you gather together, bhikkhus, you should do either of two things: hold discussion on the Dhamma or maintain noble silence\u201d.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>* In the following sutta the Blessed One advised the Sangha not to talk of pointless matters such as: talk about kings, robbers, states countries etc. but if they wanted to have a conversation, they should talk about the following matters:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cBhikkhus, it is not suitable for you, \u2026who have gone forth from the household life into homelessness out of faith, to engage in various kinds of pointless talk\u2026 there are, bhikkhus, these ten topics of discussion. What ten? Talk on fewness of desires, on contentment, on solitude, on not being bound up with others, on arousing energy, on virtuous behavior, on concentration, on wisdom, on liberation, on knowledge and vision of liberation\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Note:  The Buddha also advised the Sangha to speak to others in holy life and encourage them to talk about the ten subjects mentioned above.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Things to be Abandoned</h2>\n<p>Often in the scriptures we see the Buddha saying to his disciples that a Perfectly Enlightened Buddha appears in the world because there are three things: birth, old age and death existing in the world. In the following sutta he shows the Sangha how to abandon these three things that bring suffering. A summary of his advice is given below:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1) to abandon birth, old age and death, one must overcome greed, hate and delusion.</p>\n<p>2) to abandon greed, hatred and delusion, one must overcome personal-existence view, doubt, and wrong grasp of behaviour and observances.</p>\n<p>3) to abandon personal-existence view, doubt, and wrong grasp of behavior and observances, one must overcome careless attention, following a wrong path, and mental sluggishness.</p>\n<p>4) to abandon careless attention, following a wrong path, and mental sluggishness, one must overcome muddle-mindedness, lack of clear comprehension, and mental distraction.</p>\n<p>5) to abandon muddle-mindedness, lack of clear comprehension, and mental distraction, one must overcome a lack of desire to see the noble ones and to hear the noble Dhamma, and a mind bent on criticism.</p>\n<p>6) to abandon a lack of desire to see the noble ones and to hear the noble Dhamma, and a mind bent on criticism, one must overcome restlessness, non-restraint, and immorality.</p>\n<p>7) to abandon restlessness, non-restraint, and immorality, one must overcome a lack of faith, uncharitableness, and laziness.</p>\n<p>8) to abandon a lack of faith, uncharitableness, and laziness, one must overcome disrespect, being difficult to correct, and bad friendship.</p>\n<p>9) to abandon disrespect, being difficult to correct, and bad friendship, one must overcome moral shamelessness, moral recklessness, and heedlessness.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Reflections of One who has Gone Forth</h2>\n<p>Often, we see in the scriptures the Blessed One emphasising the importance of knowing what is unwholesome and how to develop wholesome qualities for the enhancement of one\u2019s spiritual life.</p>\n<p>The Buddha said that when a monk or nun reflects daily on the following matters, they will be able to abandon conceit and other unwholesome things:</p>\n<p>1) I have entered upon a classless condition (as a monk or nun they have up the status they previously had in lay life, such as caste, rich or poor, educated or not etc.)</p>\n<p>2)  My living is dependent upon others (since monastics are not allowed to use money, they have to depend on the support of the lay people)</p>\n<p>3) My behaviour should be different (not to act like lay people but act with mindfulness and restrain)</p>\n<p>4) Do I blame myself in regard to virtuous behaviour? (investigation of keeping precepts etc.)</p>\n<p>5) Do my wise fellow monks, having investigated, reproach me in regard to virtuous behaviour?</p>\n<p>6) I must be parted and separated from everyone and everything dear and agreeable to me (to see the impermanency of life)</p>\n<p>7) Reflect on one\u2019s actions: I am the owner of my kamma, the heir of my kamma; I have kamma as my origin, kamma as my relative, kamma as my resort; I will be the heir of whatever kamma, good or bad, that I do (it would help to do only wholesome actions)</p>\n<p>8) How am I spending my nights and days? (to act in heedfulness).</p>\n<p>9) Do I take delight in empty huts? (to be in seclusion)</p>\n<p>10) Have I attained any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones, so that in my last days, when I am questioned by my fellow monks, I will not be embarrassed? (to encourage them to attain noble status and freedom from suffering)</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>More Reflections for the Sangha</h2>\n<p>The Buddha often pointed out subjects that should be reflected on by the Sangha. Here we can see some of the reflections recommended by the Blessed One.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>To be an Island to oneself</h3>\n<p>The Buddha advised thus:</p>\n<p>\u201cAnanda, you should live as islands unto yourselves, being your own refuge, with no one else as your refuge, with the Dhamma as an island, with the Dhamma as your refuge, with no other refuge. And how does a monk live as an island unto himself ... with no other refuge? Here, \u0100nanda, a monk abides contemplating the body as body, earnestly, clearly aware, mindful and having put away all hankering and fretting for the world, and likewise with regard to feelings, mind and mind-objects\u2026and those who now in my time or afterwards live thus, they will become the highest, if they are desirous of learning.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Buddha advising Venerable \u00c3nanda : Picture courtesy: https://www.wayofbodhi.org/attadipa-sutta-dwelling-as-a-lamp-unto-onesel</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Respect Teachers, Elders and Other Members of the Sangha</h2>\n<p>For the spiritual growth of the Sangha the Blessed One often advised then to be respectful and honour others worthy of respect. In this category the Buddha insisted that being respectful andobedient to the Teacher is vital. To respect and honour elders in Dhamma too is important as they would often give them correct advice and show them the right way to enhance their spiritual life. The Buddha also insisted that the Sangha should respect the fellow monks or nuns for the sake of harmony and as an example for lay people. Such conduct brings benefits as outlined in the following extract:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026when a bhikkhu is reverential and deferential, and his behaviour is congenial to his fellow monks, it is possible for him to fulfill the duty of proper conduct. Having fulfilled the duty of proper conduct, it is possible for him to fulfill the duty of a trainee. Having fulfilled the duty of a trainee, it is possible for him to fulfill virtuous behaviour. (4) Having fulfilled virtuous behaviour, it is possible for him to fulfill right view. (5) Having fulfilled right view, it is possible for him to fulfill right samadhi\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Reflection on Ten Perceptions.</h2>\n<p>In this sutta the Blessed One recommended the following ten reflections:</p>\n<p>1) Impermanency- to see the instability of the world 2) Nonself \u2013 one is not able to control 3) Unattractiveness of the body 4) Danger to the body through various illnesses and elements 5) Abandoning unwholesome thoughts 6) Dispassion towards the world and reflection on peace- nibb\u0101na 7) Reflection on cessation of all acquisitions and the peacefulness of liberation 8) non-delight in the world 9) Impermanence of all conditioned things 10) Mindfulness of breathing.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>The Final Advice of the Buddha</h2>\n<p>Then the Lord said to the monks:</p>\n<p>\u2018Now, monks, I declare to you: all conditioned things are of a nature to decay \u2014 strive on untiringly.\u2019</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>End Notes: Section 11</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>AN2: 5.</p>\n<p>SN56: 11 (Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta)</p>\n<p>MN: 19 (Dvedh\u0101vitakka Sutta)</p>\n<p>MN:10. * The Pali reads ek\u0101yano aya\u1e41 bhikkhave maggo, and virtually all translators understand this as a statement upholding satipat\u1e6d h\u0101na as an exclusive path.

    "page11_2": "<h1>Section 11-2: Advice and Guidance to Lay Followers</h1>\n<p>Of the life of 45 years of the Buddha dedicated to teaching Dhamma we can see that he also was concerned of the progress of his lay followers\u2014their happiness at home life and</p>\n<p>progress of their spiritual life. The Blessed One encouraged his white-clad lay followers (called as upasaka and upasika) to uphold the five precepts, to observe eight precepts on Full moon days and to lead a harmless life with kindness and compassion towards other beings.  Following are selected extracts form scriptures to show how the Buddha guided his lay followers.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Buddha giving advice to lay followers: picture courtesy: https://www.facebook.com/BuddhismPathToNirvana/photos</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>How to Live a Household Life with Peace and Happiness</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Advice to Young Sig\u0101laka</h3>\n<p>On one occasion the Buddha met a young householder Sig\u0101laka who was paying homage to the six directions. Then the Blessed One asked the purpose of his action, he said:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u2018Lord, my father, when he was dying, told me to do so. And so, Lord, out of respect for my father\u2019s words, which I revere, honour and hold sacred, I have got up thus early to pay homage in this way to the six directions\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>After listening to young Sig\u0101laka, the Buddha told him the way in which an ariyan disciple pay homage to the six directions is different from his practice. When Sig\u0101laka asked of that practice the Buddha said thus:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026young householder, it is by abandoning the four defilements of action, the four causes, by not following the six ways of wasting one\u2019s substance  by not doing evil from- through avoiding these fourteen evil ways \u2014 that the Ariyan disciple covers the six directions, and by such practice becomes a conqueror of both worlds, so that all will go well with him in this world and the next, and at the breaking up of the body after death he will go to a good destiny, a heavenly world\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Note: Four defilements are: 1) Taking life, 2) taking what is not given, 3) sexual misconduct, 4) lying speech these defilements spring up due to greed, ill will, foolishness and fear, six ways of wasting one\u2019s wealth: 1) addiction to strong drink and drugs, 2) haunting the streets at unfitting times 3) attending carnivals 4) being addicted to gambling 5) keeping bad company 6) habitual idleness</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Picture courtesy: https://declutterthemind.com/</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>To do good, abandon evil</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cIf one regards oneself as dear</p>\n<p>One should not yoke oneself to evil,</p>\n<p>For happiness is not easily gained</p>\n<p>By one who does a wrongful deed\u2026</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Therefore, one should do what is good</p>\n<p>As a collection for the future life.</p>\n<p>Merits are the support for living beings</p>\n<p>When they arise in the other world.</p>\n<p>SN: 3:4 (Dear sutta)</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>On one occasion brahmin householders of Veludv\u0101ra village approached the Blessed One and said:</h3>\n<p>\u201cMaster Gotama, we have such wishes, desires, and hopes as these: \u2018may we dwell in a home crowded with children!...we enjoy K\u0101sian sandalwood! \u2026we wear garlands, scents\u2026 we receive gold and silver! with the breakup of the body, after death, may we be reborn in a good destination\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Blessed One then advised them:</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen, householders, the noble disciple possesses \u2026seven good qualities and \u2026.four desirable states, if he wishes he could by himself declare of himself: \u2018I am one finished with hell, finished with the animal realm, finished with the domain of ghosts, finished with the plane of misery, the bad destinations, the nether world. I am a stream-enterer, no longer bound to the nether world, fixed in destiny, with enlightenment as my destination.\u2019</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Note: 7 Good qualities: purifying 3 ways of bodily and verbal conduct: by not doing them, urge others not to do them, praising of not doing bad deeds: 1) not killing 2) not stealing 3) no adultery 4) no false speech 5) no harsh speech 6) no divisive speech 7 no idle chatter. Four desirable states: 1-3 confidence in the Buddha, Dhamma and Sangaha 4) possessing unbroken virtue.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>On one occasion, young Koliyan D\u012bghaj\u0101\u1e47u approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him and said:</h3>\n<p>\u201cBhante, we are laymen enjoying sensual pleasures, living at home in a house full of children. We use sandalwood from K\u0101si; we wear garlands, scents, and unguents; we receive gold and silver. Let the Blessed One teach us the Dhamma in a way that will lead to our welfare and happiness in this present life and in future lives.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Buddha said:</p>\n<p>\u201cThere are, Byagghapajja, these four things that lead to the welfare and happiness of a clansman in this present life. What four? 1) Accomplishment in initiative, 2) accomplishment in protection,3) good friendship, and 4) balanced living\u2026 There are, Byagghapajja, these four other things that lead to a clansman\u2019s welfare and happiness in future lives. What four? 5) Accomplishment in faith, 6) accomplishment in virtuous behaviour, 7) accomplishment in generosity, 8) and accomplishment in wisdom.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cEnterprising in his occupations,</p>\n<p>heedful in his arrangements,</p>\n<p>balanced in his way of living,</p>\n<p>he safeguards the wealth he earns.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Endowed with faith, accomplished in virtue,</p>\n<p>charitable and devoid of miserliness,</p>\n<p>he constantly purifies the path</p>\n<p>that leads to safety in future lives\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Note: The four accomplishments in householder\u2019s life (satara sangrha vastu) : 1) Accomplishment in initiative: skilful and diligent and have a sound judgment in order to carry out and arrange properly belonged to oneself 2) accomplishment in protection: he make arrangements to protect his wealth from kings, robbers unsuitable heirs taking it, and prevent destruction from fire and flood. 3) Cultivating good friendship: association with wise people leads him to develop his spiritual faculties 4) Balance living: he knows his income and accordingly set up his expenditure. He avoids womanizing, drunkenness, gambling and bad friends.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Importance of Taking Care of Parents</h2>\n<p>The Buddha often insisted, that people should take care of their parents. In this regard the Buddha pointed out two important things: 1) Providing material comforts to ones\u2019 parents 2)</p>\n<p>Supporting them to establish in Dhamma\u2014take refuge in the Triple Gem; guiding them into develop Right View, so they could attain the first level of spirituality\u2014 to be a stream winner.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Blessed One did not just advise others about treating their parents with respect. The Buddha not only helped his own parents but also his stepmother, who had adopted him when he was young, to develop spiritually and to liberated from samsara suffering. We have discussed this is detail in section:2 of this compilation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Following are some details from the scriptures, elaborating the advices and guidance of the Buddha towards the welfare of one\u2019s parents:</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Parents are the First Teachers of Children</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201c Mother and father are called \u2018Brahm\u0101\u2019 (great!)</p>\n<p>and also \u201cfirst teachers.\u201d</p>\n<p>They are worthy of gifts from their children,</p>\n<p>for they have compassion for their offspring.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Therefore, a wise person should revere them,</p>\n<p>and show them due honor,</p>\n<p>serve them with food and drink,</p>\n<p>with clothes and bedding,</p>\n<p>by massaging and bathing them,</p>\n<p>and by washing their feet</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Because of this service</p>\n<p>to mother and father,</p>\n<p>the wise praise one in this world</p>\n<p>and after death one rejoices in heaven\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Two Persons that Cannot Easily be Repaid</h3>\n<p>The Buddha said that\u2019s to repay one\u2019s parents is hard. If they can establish them in spiritual life, then one is able to repay their parents. He said:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026even if one were to establish one\u2019s parents as the supreme lords and rulers over this great earth abounding in the seven treasures, one still would not have done enough for one\u2019s parents, nor would one have repaid them. For what reason? Parents are of great help to their children; they bring them up, feed them, and show them the world\u2026 if, when one\u2019s parents lack faith, one establishes them in faith\u2026 in virtuous behaviour\u2026 in generosity; \u2026 in wisdom: in such a way, one has done enough for one\u2019s parents, repaid them, and done more than enough for them\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cThe wise person, dwelling at home,</p>\n<p>truly lives for the good of many.</p>\n<p>Day and night diligent toward</p>\n<p>his mother, father, and ancestors,</p>\n<p>he venerates them in accordance with the Dhamma,</p>\n<p>recollecting what they did for him in the past\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Important of Making Merits and Sharing them</h2>\n<p>Another important advice given to lay followers were to make merits and share them with their departed relatives who are waiting to get merits from their relatives. Some of the advices of the Buddha in this matter are highlighted below:</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Merits is a Designation for Happiness</h3>\n<p>The Buddha advised everyone (including his disciples) not to be afraid of making meris. In the following passage, he described how he had made merits which were beneficial to him for his many rebirths in samsara:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201c do not be afraid of merit. This is a designation for happiness, \u2026I recall that for a long time I experienced the desirable, lovely, agreeable result of merit that had been made over a long</p>\n<p>time. For seven years I developed a mind of loving-kindness. As a consequence, for seven eons of world-dissolution and evolution I did not come back to this world\u2026I fared on to the realm of streaming radiance. When the world was evolving there, I was Brahm\u0101\u2026 Sakka\u2026 many hundreds of times I was a wheel-turning monarch\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Therefore, one desiring the good,</p>\n<p>aspiring for greatness,</p>\n<p>should deeply revere the good Dhamma,</p>\n<p>recollecting the Buddhas\u2019 teaching.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>More Benefits of Making Merits</h3>\n<p>In the following sutta the Buddha pointed out living in a suitable place and association with good friends support a person to make merits which would bring him good fortune:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026When a person dwells in a suitable locality</p>\n<p>and makes friends with the noble ones,</p>\n<p>when he has formed right resolutions,</p>\n<p>and done deeds of merit in the past,</p>\n<p>grain, riches, fame, and reputation,</p>\n<p>along with happiness accrue to him\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Merits Supports Good Rebirths</h3>\n<p>In the following sutta the Blessed One described how to make merits by giving gifts, food etc. to others such as virtuous persons, visitors, one going on a journey, to a sick person. The merits made in this life bring happiness for the present life and also for lives in the other world</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Therefore, with a non-regressing mind,</p>\n<p>one should give a gift where it yields great fruit.</p>\n<p>Merits are the support of living beings</p>\n<p>when they arise in the other world\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>* When Suppav\u0101s\u0101, Koliyan daughter  , gave food to the Buddha and the Sangha, the Buddha praised her and said that her generosity would bring good fortune:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026those recollecting such generosity</p>\n<p>dwell in the world inspired by joy.</p>\n<p>Having removed the stain of miserliness and its root, blameless,</p>\n<p>they go to the heavenly abode\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>* In the following sutta the Buddha said that there are three bases of meritorious activity and they bring good rebirths.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>What three? The basis of meritorious activity consisting in giving; the basis of meritorious activity consisting in virtuous behaviour; and the basis of meritorious activity consisting in</p>\n<p>meditative development. Even if one practice these three bases in average way, he will be reborn among humans in a favourable condition. If someone practice\u2026 in superior way he will be reborn in Deva realms.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Sharing Merits (punna) with Departed Relatives</h3>\n<p>In Buddhist culture sharing merits of good deeds is a common feature. In the scriptures we can see many instances where the Buddha advising people to give merits to their departed relatives.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>* On one occasion when King Bimbisara offered the 1st monastery to the Buddha and the sangha, he accrued much merits. Tradition says that during that occasion some of his relatives from former life waited to receive merits but failing appeared in a dream. The King had been disturbed by the bad dream inquired form the Buddha about it. The Blessed One with his supernormal powers understood that the former relatives in Petha realm were waiting for merits. Hence, the king gave food and other requestees to the Buddha and sangha and shared merits with his former relatives. Because of given merits they rejoiced and been released from their woeful status.    Afterwards, the Blessed one gave a discourse to the king regarding importance of sharing merits with departed relatives thus:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201c They stand beyond the walls,</p>\n<p>and at the junctions and crossroads,</p>\n<p>they stand at the door-posts,</p>\n<p>having come to their former homes.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But when abundant food and drink,</p>\n<p>both staple and non-staple, is prepared,</p>\n<p>no one remembers these</p>\n<p>beings, because of their past unwholesome deeds,</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Thus, those who are compassionate</p>\n<p>give to their departed relatives,</p>\n<p>at the right time, pure, excellent,</p>\n<p>suitable drink and food.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Thinking: \"May this go to our relatives,</p>\n<p>may our relatives be happy!\"</p>\n<p>Those who have gathered,</p>\n<p>the departed relatives who have assembled</p>\n<p>around the food and drink,</p>\n<p>respectfully offer their thanks:</p>\n<p>saying: \" May our relatives live long!</p>\n<p>Those to whom we owe this gain,</p>\n<p>for we have been honoured,</p>\n<p>those who give are not without reward!\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>*  The following sutta also highlights the importance of offering merits to the departed relatives.</p>\n<p>On one occasion Brahmin J\u0101\u1e47usso\u1e47\u012b   approached the Blessed One and asked:</p>\n<p>\u201cMaster Gotama, we brahmins give gifts and perform the memorial rites for the dead with the thought: \u2018let our gift be of benefit to our departed relatives\u2026 let our departed relatives partake of our gift\u2026can our gift, actually be of benefit to our departed relatives?\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Buddha, then gave detailed description of departed beings who had taken rebirth in a certain realm, who could benefit from such offerings. The Blessed One also pointed out that it is impossible to say that in this long samsara journey, our relatives and friends were not born in unfortunate places where they were waiting to get merits from their relatives. The Buddha concluded by saying that there are beings who can benefit from alms given in memory of the dead. Likewise, people who offer such alms also receive much merit. Brahmin J\u0101\u1e47usso\u1e47\u012b, understood the teaching said:</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s astounding and amazing, Master Gotama, that there is reason to give gifts and perform the memorial rites for the dead, since for the donor too it is not fruitless\u201d.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>How to Take Food in order to Maintain Good Health.</h2>\n<p>The Buddha has advised his followers how to partake their meals so they can have a good digest which help for healthy life. He also often pointed out that healthy body would support to develop meditation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cWhen a man is always mindful ...</p>\n<p>Knowing moderation in the food he eats</p>\n<p>His ailments then diminish:</p>\n<p>He ages slowly, guarding his life\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>How Buddhists Should Dwell in Home Life</h2>\n<p>Often in scriptures we can see the Buddha advising lay flowers to be generous towards monks, nuns and other ascetics who need support to maintain their spiritual life, and to support family and relatives, poor and beggars who need food, clothing etc. He also encouraged them to develop meditation, especially recollections (anusati bhavana) of the Triple Gem, their generosity and virtue, higher queitites of Deva etc. Following suttas elaborate this point.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>On one occasion Mahanama the Sakyan approached the Buddha as asked: how should one dwell in lay life with various duties and engagements etc. Then the Blessed One showed him the way: To be successful in homelife one must have faith, energy, mindfulness, stillness of mind and wisdom. Then one must develop further 6 things: 1-3 recollection of the qualities of Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha (anusati ). To recollect one\u2019s own: 4 virtue, 5 generosity & 6 qualities of Devas.</h3>\n<p>Note: Details of anusati bhavana are given in the above suttas.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Keeping Precepts Brings Happiness in this Life and Favourable Rebirth.</h2>\n<p>The Buddha has shown his men and women lay followers the importance of observing the Five Precepts on daily basis and the Eight Precepts on Uposatha days.</p>\n<p>Following is some of the suttas carrying this message:</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Keeping five precepts</h3>\n<p>The following sutta points out the benefits of keeping five precepts.</p>\n<p>The Buddha said:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cThere are\u2026 these five gifts, great gifts, primal, of long standing, traditional, ancient, unadulterated and never before adulterated\u2026not repudiated by wise ascetics and brahmins. What five?</p>\n<p>1) abstain from destruction of life2) \u2013 5) abstain from: taking what is not given\u2026from sexual misconduct\u2026from false speech\u2026 from liquor, wine, and intoxicants. - this gives to an immeasurable number of beings freedom from fear, enmity, and affliction. He himself enjoys freedom from fear, enmity, and affliction. Keeping these precepts led a person to be happy in this life and to gain a good rebirth.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Keeping eight precepts</h3>\n<p>One should not kill living beings or take what is not given;</p>\n<p>one should not speak falsehood or drink intoxicants;</p>\n<p>one should refrain from sexual activity, from unchastity;</p>\n<p>one should not eat at night or at an improper time.</p>\n<p>One should not wear garlands or apply scents;</p>\n<p>one should sleep on a low bed or a mat on the ground;</p>\n<p>this, they say, is the eight-factored uposatha</p>\n<p>proclaimed by the Buddha,</p>\n<p>who reached the end of suffering.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Whatever wealth exists in this sphere\u2014</p>\n<p>pearls, gems, and excellent beryl,</p>\n<p>horn gold and mountain gold\u2026</p>\n<p>those are not worth a sixteenth part</p>\n<p>of an uposatha complete in the eight factors\u2026</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Therefore, a virtuous woman or man,</p>\n<p>having observed the uposatha complete in eight factors</p>\n<p>and having made merit productive of happiness,</p>\n<p>blameless goes to a heavenly state</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Generosity</h2>\n<p>The Buddha constantly praised almsgiving and pointed out to laypeople the benefits of giving alms to the ascetics, gifts to the people in need, sick people etc.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>* In the following sutta the Buddha pointed out how a good person should give gifts:</p>\n<p>(1) He gives what is pure; (2) he gives what is excellent; (3) he gives a timely gift; (4) he gives what is allowable; (5) he gives after investigation; (6) he gives often; (7) while giving he settles his mind in confidence; and (8) having given, he rejoiced</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>He gives what is pure and excellent,</p>\n<p>allowable drinks and food at the proper time;</p>\n<p>he gives gifts often to fertile fields of merit,</p>\n<p>to those who lead the spiritual life.</p>\n<p>He does not feel regret,</p>\n<p>having given away many material things.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Those with deep insight praise</p>\n<p>the gifts given in this way.</p>\n<p>Having thus practiced charity</p>\n<p>with a mind freely generous,</p>\n<p>one intelligent and wise, rich in faith,</p>\n<p>is reborn in a pleasant, unafflicted world</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Faith, moral shame, and wholesome giving</p>\n<p>are qualities pursued by the good person;</p>\n<p>for this, they say, is the divine path</p>\n<p>by which one goes to the world of the devas</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>How to be Free from Suffering</h2>\n<p>On one occasion Bhadraka the headman approached the Buddha and said:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cIt would be good, venerable sir, if the Blessed One would teach me about the origin and the passing away of suffering\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Buddha used the method of dialogue to teach Dhamma to so Bhadraka could himself realise how the suffering come to be and how it passes away:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Buddha: \u201cWhat do you think, headman? are there any people in Uruvelakappa on whose account sorrow\u2026 pain\u2026would arise in you if they were to be executed, imprisoned\u2026 or censured?\u201d</p>\n<p>Bhadraka: \u201cThere are such people, venerable sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>Buddha: \u201cBut are there any people in Uruvelakappa on whose account sorrow\u2026 pain, \u2026would not arise in you in such an event?</p>\n<p>Bhadraka: \u201cThere are such people, venerable sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>Buddha: What\u2026is the cause and reason why in relation to some people \u2026sorrow, and pain, arise in you if they were to be executed\u2026while in regard to others no such sorrow\u2026 pain, would arise in you?</p>\n<p>Bhadraka: \u201cThose people\u2026 in in relation to whom sorrow\u2026pain, would arise in me if they were to be executed\u2026these are the ones for whom I have \u2026attachment\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Then the Blessed One said:</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026whatever suffering arose in the past\u2026whatever suffering will arise in the future, all that will arise rooted in desire, with desire as its source; for desire is the root of suffering.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u201cIn this way too, headman, it can be understood: \u2018Whatever suffering arises, all that arises rooted indesire, with desire as its source; for desire is the root of suffering.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In this way the Buddha showed Bhadraka, how to identify causes of suffering and to abandon it in order to lead be free and peaceful</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>How to Recognize Good and Wise Person</h2>\n<p>One of the advices that the Buddha consistently gave to his devotees was to associate with wise people and not with foolish people. The opening stanza of the Mangala Sutta is:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"Not associating with fools,</p>\n<p>with the wise associating\u2026</p>\n<p>honouring that worthy of honour:</p>\n<p>this is a supreme blessing\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>How to Recognize Wise People</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>*The following was the advice given to King Pasenadi of Kosala:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201c It is by living together with someone, great king, that his virtue is to be known, \u2026it is by dealing with someone, great king, that his honesty is to be known\u2026 it is in misfortunes, great king, that a person\u2019s strength  is to be known\u2026 It is by discussion with someone, great king, that his wisdom is to be known\u2026 and that after a long time, not after a short time; by one who is attentive, not by one who is inattentive; by one who is wise, not by a fool\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cA man is not easily known by outward form</p>\n<p>Nor should one trust a quick appraisal,</p>\n<p>For in the guise of the well-controlled</p>\n<p>Uncontrolled men move in this world.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cLike a counterfeit earring made of clay,</p>\n<p>Like a bronze half-penny coated with gold,</p>\n<p>Some move about in disguise:</p>\n<p>Inwardly impure, outwardly beautiful</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>* The Buddha has shown the criteria to identify a fool and a wise person.</p>\n<p>If a person has three bad qualities \u2014 bodily misconduct, verbal misconduct, and mental misconduct he is considered to be a fool, association of such people bring harm to ones\u2019 ordinary life as well as spiritual life.

Childhood and Family Life of Prince Siddhartha</h1></h1>\n<p>In this section we are going to see the childhood and young days of Prince Siddhartha (lay life of the Gotama Buddha) and his family and some of important events connected to this period.</p>\n<p><h2>\u25b2 Prince Siddhartha\u2019s Parents</h2></p>\n<p>He was named Siddhartha meaning \u201che who achieves his goal\u201d   . According to the scriptures, Prince Siddhartha, the future Buddha, was born to the Sakyan clan from Kapilavattu. His father was King Suddhodana and his mother was Queen Mahamaya.   Following his mother\u2019s death, seven days after his birth  , Queen Maya\u2019s sister, Queen Prajapati (also a Queen consort to King Suddhodana) became the prince\u2019s foster mother   Prince Siddhartha had a half-brother, Prince Nanda and a half-sister, Princess Nand\u0101, who were children of King Suddhodana and Queen Prajapati. Queen Prajapati is remembered throughout history as she later became the first Bhikkhuni in what was to be the Buddha\u2019s community of nuns.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><h3>\u2666 References to the Buddha\u2019s family can be found in the Suttas, few extracts are listed below.</h3></p>\n<p>In Mah\u00e2pad\u0101na Sutta (DN:14) includes a passage where the Devas mention the parents of the Buddha:</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026in this fortunate aeon now, the Lord Buddha has arisen in the world\u2026 his father is King Suddhodana, his mother was Queen Maya, and his royal capital is Kapilavattu\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>In the same sutta, the Buddha elaborated:</h3>\n<p>\u201c\u2026and now, monks, my father was King Suddhodana, my mother was Queen Maya, and the royal capital was Kapilavattu\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>In the Udana, Ven \u0100nanda Thera refers to Queen Maya\u2019s passing away seven days after the Buddha\u2019s birth:</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026it\u2019s incredible, sir, it\u2019s amazing! How short-lived was the Blessed One\u2019s mother!</p>\n<p>For seven days after the Blessed One was born, his mother passed away and was reborn in</p>\n<p>the host of joyful gods (Tusita heaven) ...\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Buddha responds:</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s so true, \u0100nanda! For the mothers of beings\u2019 intent of awakening are short-</p>\n<p>lived. Seven days after the being\u2019s intent on awakening are born, their mothers pass away</p>\n<p>and are reborn in the host of joyful gods\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Ven K\u0101lud\u0101yi Thera   a disciple of the Buddha said this:</h3>\n<p>\u201c\u2026Suddhodana is the name of the Great Seer\u2019s father, and M\u0101y\u0101 name of the Buddha\u2019s mother who, having nurtured the bodhisatta with her womb, at the break-up of the body, rejoices in the threefold divine realm. She, Gotam\u012b, having passed away, having fallen away from here, is now endowed with heavenly sensual pleasures\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>In Dakkhi\u1e47\u0101vibhanga Sutta (MN:142) the flowing extract also confirmed that Queen Mahapajapati was the foster mother of the Buddha. In this sutta Venerable \u00c3nanda said:</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026 Mah\u0101paj\u0101pat\u012b Gotam\u012b has been very helpful to the Blessed One, venerable sir. As his mother\u2019s sister, she was his nurse, his foster mother, the one who gave him milk. She suckled the Blessed One when his own mother died\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Queen Prajapati, refers to her role as the Buddha\u2019s foster mother:</h3>\n<p>\u201c\u2026Sublime One, I am your foster mother, but you gave me the milk of the True Dhamma, therefore you are my Father\u2026 Greatest Hero, I have raised you by nursing you...and You are the One who supported me to build this Dhamma body. I quenched your thirst with my breast milk, the Dhamma milk given by you extinguished my worldly desires. The positions of \u2018King\u2019s mother\u2019\u2026\u2019Kings wife\u2019; are worthy titles for women, but the title of \u201cBuddha\u2019s mother\u201d is more great, more novel, grander\u2026!\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Prince Siddhartha (Gotama Buddha) with Maha Pajapati Gotami\u2014Foster mother</p>\n<p>Picture Courtesy: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><h2>\u25b2 Prince Siddhartha\u2019s Childhood</h2></p>\n<p>Prince Siddhartha grew up in princely luxury, shielded from the outside world. Two important and unusual \u201cspiritual\u201d events, a precursor to the path that he would subsequently follow, are documented in the scriptures.</p>\n<h3>Prophesy about Buddhahood</h3>\n<p>The first event occurred when a famous ascetic, Asita (also called K\u0101ladevala), visited King Suddhodana, to see the new born prince.

After becoming the Buddha, the Blessed One recalled that incident thus:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026I recall that when my father the Sakyan was occupied, while I was sitting in the cool shade of a rose- apple tree, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, I entered upon and abided in the first jh\u0101na, which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought, with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion\u2026\u2019</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Prince Siddhartha meditated during the Ploughing Festival.

Since at this  point we are describing the family of the Buddha, we thought it is appropriate to mention how the Buddha, after attaining enlightenment, guided his parents and close family members to develop spiritual life to end the suffering of samsara. The relevant details are given below.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Princess Yasodhar\u0101</h2>\n<p>According to legends, Princess Yasodhar\u0101 (Bhadd\u0101 Kacc\u0101n\u0101) was married to Prince Siddhartha when they were both aged sixteen  . Princess Yasodhar\u0101\u2019s father was King Suppabuddha of the Koliya clan of Devadaha city and her mother was Amita Devi (sister of King Suddhodana). They had a son, R\u0101hula. Yasodhar\u0101 later ordained as a bhikkhuni and attained full Enlightenment. The Buddha declared her as the foremost bhikkhuni to have attained great direct knowledge   .</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>When Yasodhar\u0101 Theri was 78 years old, before her Parinibb\u0101na, her final passing, she paid her respect to the Blessed One and said this:</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026Iam Yasodhar\u0101, Hero; in the home I was your chief queen, born in the clan of the \u015a\u0101kyas, established among the women in your household, O Hero, I was the leader, the lord of all of the women there \u2026 \u201cI am Yasodhar\u0101, Hero; I worship your feet, Eyeful One\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Arahant Bhikkhuni Yasodhar\u0101 : Picture courtesy:Pinterest</p>\n<p>https://in.pinterest.com/pin</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Above:  Prince Nanda following the   Blessed One- though he was carrying the bowl of the Buddha his mind was on his wife to be \u2018Janapada Kalyani\u2019 who was standing in the balcony: picture courtesy: Wikimedia Commons (Gandhara Art)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Prince Nanda</h2>\n<p>Nanda Gotama was the half-brother of the Buddha. His parents were King Suddhodana and Queen Prajapati. At one time, after his Enlightenment, the Blessed One on invitation by his father, visited Kapilavattu. At that time, Prince Nanda was to marry a beautiful Sakyan maiden known as \u2018Janapada Kalyani\u2019 (meaning the most beautiful maiden of the province). After taking his meal at his father\u2019s palace, the Buddha gave his alms bowl to Prince Nanda and walked with him to the monastery.  When the Bleared One asked Prince Nanda whether he would like to become a monk, out of respect to the Buddha, Nanda consented, although his thoughts were still of his lay life and his former bride to be. Nanda wanted to return to his former life as a royal prince.  When the Blessed One came to know of his intention, using his spiritual powers, he transported Nanda into the Tavatimsa Deva realm where there were many beautiful deva maidens.  Showing them to Nanda, the Blessed One said:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026Rejoice, Nanda, rejoice! I guarantee you five hundred dove-footed nymphs.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Nanda responded:</p>\n<p>\u201cIf, sir, you guarantee me five hundred dove-footed nymphs, I shall happily lead the spiritual life under the Buddha.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>When his fellow monks came to know that the bhikkhu Nanda was leading his spiritual life to gain access to divine maidens, they mocked him and laughed at him.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026then Nanda\u2014embarrassed, ashamed\u2026. living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realised the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life\u2026Venerable Nanda became one of the perfected\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Buddha declared that among the Bhikkhu Sangha of those who guard the doors of the</p>\n<p>sense faculties Nanda was the foremost</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In his Thera Gatha, the noble Nanda Thera said thus:</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026because of focusing on the wrong things,</p>\n<p>I was addicted to ornamentation.</p>\n<p>I was vain\u2026desire for pleasures of the senses.</p>\n<p>But with the help of the Buddha,</p>\n<p>the kinsman of the Sun, so skilled in means,</p>\n<p>I practiced rationally and extracted attachment</p>\n<p>to continued existence from my mind\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In his Apadana, Nanda Thero mentioned that in one of his former births he</p>\n<p>worshipped the Buddha Padumuttara and this is what the Buddha said about his future life:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026after spending heavenly and human pleasures, due to good kamma, you will be born as a younger brother of Buddha Gotama\u2026 attached to sensual pleasures you will be guided by the Blessed One, \u2026will be peaceful and attain to arahathood\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Princess Nand\u0101 Gotami</h2>\n<p>Like prince Nanda, princess Nand\u0101\u2019s parents were King Suddhodana and Queen Prajapati, hence she was the half-sister of the Buddha. Tradition says that she was beautiful and so was called Sundar\u012b Nand\u0101 (beautiful Nand\u0101). When her mother Queen Prajapati, renounced lay life and became the first Bhikkhuni, out of respect for her, princess Nand\u0101 also became a nun. In the beginning, Nanda\u0101 Theri, thinking about her appearance, neglected her Dhamma training. It was when the Buddha pointed out the impermanence of beauty, realising this truth, she became fully enlightened. The Blessed One declared that among bhikkhuni meditators Nand\u0101 Theri was foremost</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Buddha advising Nand\u0101 Theri. Picture courtesy: Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundari_Nanda</p>\n<p>* In Theri Gatha of Venarable Nand\u0101 stated how the Buddha regularly advised her with these verses:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026Nand\u0101, see this bag of bones as diseased, filthy, and rotten. With mind unified and serene, meditate on the ugly aspects of the body.

He was known as R\u0101hula Bhadda (lucky R\u0101hula) because he was fortunate to be the son of the Blessed One.  Though his father prince Siddhartha left home to be an ascetic, legend says that Prince R\u0101hula had a comfortable life with his mother and grand-parents.  The Vinaya Pitaka gives the following description of how prince R\u0101hula, was ordained at the age of seven.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026after staying at R\u0101jagaha for as long as he liked, the Buddha set out wandering toward Kapilvatthu in the Sakyan country. When he eventually arrived, he stayed in the Banyan Tree Monastery. In the morning the Buddha robed up, took his bowl and robe, and went to Suddhodana the Sakyan\u2019s house where he sat down on the prepared seat.  Queen, Yasodhara, mother of R\u0101hula, said to the boy:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u2018This is your father, R\u0101hula. Go and ask for your inheritance.\u201d</p>\n<p>R\u0101hula went up to the Buddha, stood in front of him, and said, \u2018Ascetic, your shadow is pleasant.\u2019  When the Buddha got up from his seat and left, R\u0101hula followed behind, saying:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cGive me my inheritance! Give me my inheritance!\u201d</p>\n<p>The Buddha said to Venerable S\u0101riputta:</p>\n<p>\u2018Well then, S\u0101riputta, give R\u0101hula the going forth.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>When King Suddhodana heard that his cherished grandson R\u0101hula had become a monk, he was overcome by sorrow. With a heavy heart the King went to see the Buddha and told him that there is no greater grief in this world than the loss of one\u2019s \u201cbeloved children\u201d.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cWhen the Buddha went forth, it was very painful for me, and the same when Nanda went</p>\n<p>forth. With R\u0101hula, it\u2019s even worse. Affection for a child cut deep. It cuts through the outer</p>\n<p>and inner skin; it cuts through the flesh, the sinews, and the bones, and it reaches all the</p>\n<p>way to the bone-marrow. Please, may the venerable not give the going forth to a child</p>\n<p>without the parents\u2019 permission.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Above: Artist\u2019s impression of the young monk R\u0101hula, who followed the Blessed One\u2019s training faithfully and dedicatedly from the age of 7 and became an arahant at the age of 21. Picture Courtesy: https://www.originalbuddhas.com/blog</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>R\u0101hula Thera\u2019s mentor and teacher was Ven S\u0101riputta.  A few years after his higher ordination, at age twenty-one, R\u0101hula Thera became an Arahant. The special event is described in the scriptures:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201c \u2026then, while the Blessed One was alone in meditation, a thought arose in his mind thus: \u201cThe states that ripen in deliverance have ripened in R\u0101hula. Suppose I were to lead him on further to the destruction of the taints\u2026 now on that occasion many thousands of deities followed the Blessed One, thinking: \u201cToday the Blessed One will lead the venerable R\u0101hula further to the destruction of the taints\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Note: The commentary says: \u2026 those deities, who came from various celestial realms, had been companions of R\u0101hula\u2019s during the previous life in which he first made the aspiration to attain arahantship as the son of a Buddha   .</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Buddha declared Bhikkhu R\u0101hula as the foremost disciple among those desirous of training</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In his Thera Gatha this is what the noble R\u0101hula Thera said:</p>\n<p>I am known as \u201cFortunate R\u0101hula\u201d,</p>\n<p>because I\u2019m accomplished in both ways:</p>\n<p>I am the son of the Buddha,</p>\n<p>whose eye sees clearly in all things.</p>\n<p>Having thrown off those sensual pleasures,</p>\n<p>having cut M\u0101ra\u2019s bond,</p>\n<p>and having plucked out craving, root and all:</p>\n<p>I\u2019m cooled, quenched\u2026\u201d .</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In his Thera Apadana the noble R\u0101hula Thera mentioned his previous life and</p>\n<p>encounter with the Buddha Padumuttura. The Blessed One foretold his future life that he will</p>\n<p>become the son of Buddha Gotama:</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026Falling from Tusit\u0101 heaven,</p>\n<p>incited by his wholesome roots,</p>\n<p>he\u2019ll be the legitimate son</p>\n<p>of Gotama the Blessed One.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If he should remain in the house</p>\n<p>then he would be a Wheel-Turner.</p>\n<p>For that reason, an arahant can\u2019t</p>\n<p>obtain pleasure within the house.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Being well-trained he will renounce</p>\n<p>after going forth from the house.</p>\n<p>He will be known as R\u0101hula</p>\n<p>and he will become an arahant.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>The Buddha Guiding his Parents</h3>\n<p>Above, we saw how the close relatives of the Buddha, having heard his teachings, established confidence in him and followed him to become liberated from all sufferings. Often, the Blessed One instructed his followers to respect and honour their parents as it is not easy to repay them. Hence, we thought it is appropriate to mention how the Blessed One paid his due to his parents and his foster mother.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Buddha said:</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026even if one were to establish one\u2019s parents as the supreme lords and rulers over this great earth abounding in the seven treasures, one still would not have done enough for one\u2019s parents, nor would one have repaid them. For what reason? Parents are of great help to their children; they bring them up, feed them, and show them the world\u2026 if, when one\u2019s parents lack faith, one establishes them in faith\u2026 in virtuous behaviour\u2026 in generosity; \u2026 in wisdom: in such a way, one has done enough for one\u2019s parents, repaid them, and done more than enough for them\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>How the Buddha taught his father and foster mother to understand Dhamma</h3>\n<p>According to legend when the Buddha first visited Kapilavattu, he went out seeking alms from house to house. The king heard the news and was disturbed that the Buddha like a beggar going to houses form alms. Being a Sakyan and proud of kingship he rushed to the city met the Blessed One and asked the reason for doing such act. Out of compassion for the king, the Buddha said that receiving alms-food from door to door is a practice of all the Buddhas and his noble disciples.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026a bhikkhu, on receiving alms-food after standing with seemly propriety at the door of each donor, should be mindful of the receipt of the food; he should not receive or seek alms by improper manner\u2026a bhikkhu, who cultivates the practice unfailingly in such a manner, will live in peace in this life\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>At the end, the end the king was established in stream-entry (sotapatti)  . The same source mentioned that the next day the Blessed One, again stressed the importance of the Buddhas\u2019 and his disciples to receive alms food properly, listening to the teaching the king became \u2018an\u0101g\u0101mi\u2019 (the 3rd noble stage) and queen Prajapati became a stream-winner.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>King Suddhodana meeting the Buddha in Kapilavattu</p>\n<p>Source: Author: Nomu420</p>\n<p>Picture courtesy:</p>\n<p>User:Nomu420 - Wikimedia Commons</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Blessed One is said to have visited his father, King Suddhodana at his death-bed  The Buddha taught the Dhamma and the king became an arahant. He enjoyed the bliss of liberation for seven days as a lay person before passing away</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Helping Queen Prajapathi, the foster mother</h3>\n<p>In Dakkinavibhnga sutta (MN:142) there is a passage pointing out how the Buddha helped his foster mother to establish in Dhamma. The following is a quote from Venerable \u00c3nanada:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026the Blessed One too has been very helpful to Mah\u0101paj\u0101pat\u012b Gotam\u012b, venerable sir. It is owing to the Blessed One that Mah\u0101paj\u0101pat\u012b Gotam\u012b has gone for refuge to the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha \u2026it is owing to the Blessed One that Mah\u0101paj\u0101pat\u012b Gotam\u012b possesses unwavering confidence in the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha, and that she possesses the virtues loved by noble ones\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Note: * \u201c These are the four factors of stream-entry. Thus, it is clear that at the time this sutta takes place, Mah\u0101paj\u0101pat\u0131\u0304 Gotam\u0131\u0304 was already a stream-enterer\u201d.</p>\n<p>* According to scriptures Bhikkhuni Maha Prajapati Gotami initiated the establishment of Bhikkhuni Sangha, became a great teacher an arahant</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In Their Gatha, Bhikkhuni Maha Prajapati Gotami paid her gratitude to the Buddha thus:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Since I have seen the Blessed One,</p>\n<p>this bag of bones is my last.</p>\n<p>Transmigration through births is finished,</p>\n<p>now there\u2019ll be no more future lives.</p>\n<p>I see the disciples in harmony,</p>\n<p>and resolute, always staunchly vigorous\u2014</p>\n<p>this is homage to the Buddhas!</p>\n<p>It was truly for the benefit of many</p>\n<p>that M\u0101y\u0101 gave birth to Gotama.</p>\n<p>He swept away the mass of suffering</p>\n<p>for those stricken by sickness and death</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Establishing the mother who passed away and appeared in Deva Realm in Dhamma</h3>\n<p>Queen Mahamaya, according to scriptures and legend was reborn in Tusita Deva Realm as young deva called Santusita (also called mother deva). The Buddha is said to have visited the</p>\n<p>Deva world to deliver dhamma to his mother and other devas. Suntusita deva is said to have</p>\n<p>become a stream enterer.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026the Buddha went to the T\u0101vatimsa deva world, his mother who had been reborn in</p>\n<p>Tusita deva world as a deva known as Santusita also came to the T\u0101vatimsa deva world.</p>\n<p>There the Buddha expounded the Abhidhamma to the devas and the brahmas throughout</p>\n<p>the three months of the vassa (rain retreat period). As a result, Santusita deva attained sot\u0101patti fruition\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Note:  Earlier we saw a passage regarding queen Maya reborn in deva realm:</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s so true, \u0100nanda! For the mothers of beings\u2019 intent of awakening are short-</p>\n<p>lived.

Most of the information given here are gathered from scriptures, however, to elaborate certain points/events and to fill some gaps, we have taken some information from traditional Buddhist books and other sources which are documented in the End notes.</p>\n<p>* Two important events happened in this period may have imprinted in the mind of the future Buddha to let go of his princely life and to become an ascetic: 1) From his family and friends he may have heard of his future forecast by the brahmins on the day of his naming ceremony and pondered of what is better? To be a great king of wealth and power or to be an enlighten being and end all suffering?  2) the blissfulness experienced through the Samadhi as a child, the prince experienced may have brought pleasant and peaceful memories of solitude which may have grounded in his mind and may have surfaced in time to time-reminding the solace of peace in such life. Later in the compilation we can see how the memory of samadhi as child gave him insight to give up extreme ascetic practice and moved to the middle path.</p>\n<p>* Since we were talking about the family of the Buddha, we thought it is appropriate at this juncture to mentioned some important things happened to his family members because of his enlightenment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><h2>End Notes: Section 2</h2></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Naming ceremony is described in details see: Naming Ceremonies: The Great Chronicles of Buddhas by Venerable Mingun Sayadaw.</p>\n<p>Tthe Blessed One said thus: \u201c\u2026my native place is Kapilavatthu, King Suddhodana is my father, my birth mother is Queen Maya\u2026\u201d, p, 264.

When his attendants left him to watch the ploughing ceremony, the prince, finding himself all alone, spontaneously sat up in the meditation posture and attained the first jh\u0101na through mindfulness of breathing.

The entire Buddhist world is indebted to the Buddha Gotama, who embarked on such a noble task \u2013 he renounced his princely life at a very young age in order to find a solution to the cycle of repeated suffering. The story of the Great Renunciation of Prince Siddhartha sets the example of going forth from lay life to homeless life for all Buddhist monks and nuns in our world. Thus, reflecting of the suffering of sams\u0101ra, the prince saw that if he took up the homeless life, it would be possible for him to seek what he wanted, the solution to the suffering of endless births and deaths.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Before going to say about the wanderings of Ascetic Siddhartha we would like to present the causes which lead the prince to go forth from his princely life.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>What Inspired Prince Siddhartha to become an ascetic?</h2>\n<p>In a few suttas in the scriptures the Buddha has mentioned about his renunciation. Some of them are given below so that we could understand how one who was immensely involved in a princely life decided to give away his belongings and attachments and go away to unknown world of homelessness. In the following sutta the Blessed One, tells the Sangha what it was that inspired him to become a homeless wander.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Seen the suffering of life</h3>\n<p>\u201cAmid such splendour and a delicate life, it occurred to me: \u2026I too am subject to old age and am not exempt from old age. Such being the case, if I were to feel repelled, humiliated, and disgusted when seeing another who is old, that would not be proper for me.\u2019 When I reflected thus, my intoxication with youth was completely abandoned\u2026 I too am subject to illness and am not exempt from illness. Such being the case, if I were to feel repelled, humiliated, and disgusted when seeing another who is ill, that would not be proper for me.\u2019 When I reflected thus, my intoxication with health was completely abandoned\u2026 I too am subject to death and am not exempt from death. Such being the case, if I were to feel repelled, humiliated, and disgusted when seeing another who has died, that would not be proper for me.\u2019 When I reflected thus, my intoxication with life was completely abandoned\u2026\u201d.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Note: * In section 2 elaborate the luxurious life lead by the prince. Thus, Prince Siddhartha, who had well understood the intoxication of youth\u2026health, and \u2026 life, was undoubtedly shocked by the pleasures of the sensual world. As mentioned earlier (in section 2), he must have realized that the well-being and happiness obtained through Samadhi is more superior than worldly pleasures. He must have realized that everyone, including himself, is subject to the stages of old age, illness, and death. At that time, according to Indian religious beliefs he may had some idea of rebirth- not one- but many? He may have pondered how to escape from such a deadly trap?</p>\n<p>Accordingly, he left home searching a way out from worldly suffering, seeking the Truth -Good (ki\u1e43kusal\u0101nues\u012b)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Thus, reflecting on these problems, old age, sickness and death, Prince Siddhartha saw the reality of life, that everyone who is born is subject to these. The prince realised that not only himself, but also all the people he loved and in fact all the beings who are born are overwhelmed by the inevitable great sorrow of old age, sickness and death. Moreover, it was believed that this cycle of being born and dying (sams\u0101ra) was endless. Prince Siddhartha renounced his princely life in order to find a way out of these eternal problems, looking for a blissful state.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>* Later, when he became the Buddha, he said this about his noble search:</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd what is the noble search? Here someone being himself subject to birth\u2026 ageing\u2026 sickness\u2026 death\u2026 having understood the danger\u2026in what subject to birth\u2026 ageing\u2026 sickness\u2026 death \u2026seeks the unborn supreme security from bondage, Nibb\u0101na\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Home life is not conducive to practice spirituality</h3>\n<p>The following extract from scriptures also confirmed that through understanding that difficulties in worldly life the bodhisattva renounced his home life:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cHere, Aggivessana, before my enlightenment, while I was still only an unenlightened Bodhisatta, I thought: \u2018Household life is crowded and dusty; life gone forth is wide open. It is not easy, while living in a home, to lead the holy life utterly perfect and pure as a polished shell. Suppose I shave off my hair and beard, put on the yellow robe, and go forth from the home life into homelessness\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Seeking good \u2013 the truth</h3>\n<p>In Mah\u0101parinibbana sutta (DN:16), at the time of his passing away, Blessed One said this to Subhadda, the last personal disciple of the him  .</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cI went forth seeking what is good-</p>\n<p>Twenty-nine years of age I was\u2026</p>\n<p>When I went forth to seek the Good.</p>\n<p>Now over fifty years have passed</p>\n<p>Since the day that I went forth</p>\n<p>To roam the realm of wisdom\u2019s law\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>(Ek\u016bnati\u1e43so vayas\u0101 subhadda,</p>\n<p>Ya\u1e43 pabbaji\u1e43 ki\u1e43kusal\u0101nues\u012b;</p>\n<p>Vass\u0101ni pa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101sa sam\u0101dhik\u0101ni,</p>\n<p>Yato aha\u1e43 pabbajito subhadda)</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Seen the Danger in Sensual Pleasures</h3>\n<p>In Suttanipatha, there is a passage where the Ascetic Siddhartha saying the purpose of his going forth. When he had an encounter with the King Bimbisara of Magadha in the city of Rajagaha, the king impressed by the good looks and peaceful manners of the bodhisatta, offered him to share his royal pleasure with him. This is what Ascetic Siddhartha said.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cUp north, O king, on the slopes of the Himalayas,</p>\n<p>Full of wealth and strength,</p>\n<p>lies a land of one whose abode is among the Kosalanas.</p>\n<p>Their clan is named for the Sun they are Sakyans by birth,</p>\n<p>I have gone forth from that family- I do not yearn for sensual pleasures.</p>\n<p>Seeing the danger in sensual pleasures, seeing renunciation as sanctuary,</p>\n<p>I shall go on to strive that is where my mind delights\u201d.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The four sights: source: The Anthropology of Religion</p>\n<p>Picture courtesy: https://markyjc.wordpress.com/</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Note: * According to ancient Buddhist Texts, the prince witnessing the four omen of a recluse and reflecting them determined to abandon his princely life  .</p>\n<p>* Apart from a statement given in KN:Bv. (given below) we could not find any other place in the scriptures where the four signs, mentioned in traditional Buddhist stories and ancient books: 1) seen an old person 2) seen a sick person 3) seen a dead body 4) seen a peaceful recluse described as causes for Prince Siddhartha to leave his princely life:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>( mama ekun tisvasak gihigeyi v\u0101saya ke\u1e37emi...satara pera nimiti d\u00e6ka a\u015bva y\u0101nayakin abhini\u1e63kramanaya ke\u1e37emi. mama savasak du\u1e63karav\u016b pradhan v\u012briya kelemi) I lived in a house for thirty-one years... I saw four omens and set out on a horse-drawn chariot. I performed a difficult and strenuous exercise for six years. ( Nimithtena chathuro disva assayanena nikhamin \u2013 chabbassan padhancharan acari dukkarn ahan)</p>\n<p>* In Mah\u0101pad\u0101na sutta (DN:14): mentioned tht Buddha Vipaasi seen the four signs left the palace.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Did the Bodhisatta went away in the middle of night without taking leave from his family?</h2>\n<p>In Buddhist literature, the event of his going forth is described in many different ways. Traditional stories about the life of the Buddha often say that Prince Siddhartha left his family without telling them the purpose of his going away. However, in the Suttas we can see a different picture. The Buddha says this to the Sangha:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u2018Why, being myself subject to birth, do I seek what is also subject to birth? Why, being myself subject to ageing, sickness, death, sorrow, and defilement, do I seek what is also subject to ageing, sickness, death, sorrow, and defilement? Suppose that, being myself subject to birth, having understood the danger in what is subject to birth, I seek the unborn supreme security from bondage... later, while still young, a black-haired young man endowed with the blessing of youth, in the prime of life, though my mother and father wished otherwise and wept with tearful faces, I shaved off my hair and beard, put on the yellow robe, and went forth from the home life into homelessness\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Although he was young and lived a luxurious princely life, Prince Siddhartha had understood the true nature of existence, that the pleasures of life were very limited and would inevitably be followed by suffering. He may have discussed these things with his beloved Princess Yasodhara, who was also a wise lady and devoted wife. According to Jataka Stories, for countless life-times they had been husband and wife devoted to each other. In those previous lives, when our bodhisattva went forth from the home life, his wife supported him and helped him. So, in the present life also they may have held many discussions about the unsatisfactoriness of lay life and she may have understood the desire of the prince to seek the Truth.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, when the Blessed One visited his family in Kapilvatthu, Yasodhara Devi, pointed out the Buddha to her son Rahula, telling him that the Buddha was his father, and sent Prince Rahula to the Buddha to ask for the bequest due to him  .</p>\n<p>What gift can a Buddha give to his son? A Samma Sambudha has no material endowment to offer; all he has to give his son is the way to be free from sams\u0101ra suffering and attain the bliss of liberation. As a wise and loving mother who understood this, Princess Yasodhara acted in such a noble way, directing her beloved son to obtain the greatest gift in the world!  Hence, we can conclude that it is not a very realistic story that the bodhisattva, the future Buddha who had a heart full of love and compassion towards his parents, his wife and the family ran away in the dead of night without letting them know his purpose of going forth.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Above: Prince Siddhartha leaves the Palace riding his horse amidst gathering of his family and friends: Picture courtesy: Wikipedia: Source: Pakistan, Gandhara, schist, 2nd-3rd century, San Diego Museum of Art</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Wanderings of Asetc Siddhartha</h2>\n<p>In here we have gathered certain information from the scriptures, showing the activities of ascetic Siddhartha, the places he visited and people he met during the 6 years of his ascetic life. Earlier we have seen a statement made by the Blessed One saying that he spent 6 years of ascetic practice before giving it up and taking a new way to become a fully enlightened Buddha.</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026iI performed a difficult and strenuous exercise for six years\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It was not possible to have a straight chain of events of this period from the scriptures, as there were many gaps. Hence, we took the liberty to fill some of the gaps from the ancient Buddhist texts and some other recognized sources. All of the references are duly mentioned in the end notes. Summary of events are given below:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Age 29: Leaving Kapilavattu city and home life on full moon day of \u0100s\u0101\u1e37ha (Esala- month of April) to be an ascetic to discover a way out from all suffering.</p>\n<p>1) The day of departure</p>\n<p>* According to Mahaparinibbana sutta (DN:16) the Buddha said: I went forth seeking what is good- Twenty-nine years of age I was\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>* According to other sources:</p>\n<p>1) year of 595 B.C. on a full moon day of \u0100s\u0101\u1e37ha (Esala- month of April) he went forth\u2026he went ridding on his horse \u2018Kantaka\u2019 with Channa (childhood friend)</p>\n<p>2) Commentry to Samyutta Nikaya (Spk)  identifies this Channa with the Bodhisatta\u2019s charioteer who led him out of the palace on the night of his great renunciation. See: SN: Note:179, p. 11294. Bhikkhu Channa becoming an arahant is described in SN:22: 90 .</p>\n<p>2) Seven days from the day of departure</p>\n<p>* According to other sources: the prince covering 30 yojanas, crossed the river Anoma, cut his hair, discarded his princely garments and dressed like an ascetic and spent 7 days at Anupiya Mango grove, enjoying his renunciation.</p>\n<p>3) Anupiya Mango Grove to Rajagaha city</p>\n<p>* According to other sources: from Anupiya Mango grove the recluse Siddhartha walked 30 yojanas towards Magadha province and arrived at city of Rajagaha and stayed in a cave of Pandava Mountain outside the city. There he went round the city for alms and the King Bimbisara saw him and met him in the cave</p>\n<p>* According to scriptures: The bodhisatta arrived at Rajagaha and went for alms round in the city, then king Bimbisara saw him and was impressed with his good looks and serene manner followed him to the Pandava Mountain and paid respect, inquired about his clan and requested to live in the kingdom with him. As stated above in this section, Ascetic Siddhartha refused the offer  .</p>\n<p>4) From Rajagaha wandering in Magadha looking for teachers</p>\n<p>* According to scriptures: First the bodisatta met \u0100\u1e37\u0101ra K\u0101l\u0101ma, a well-known teacher of Magadha and learned under him but relaised that teaching would not guide him to escape from suffering. Then he met another famous Magadhan teacher, Uddaka R\u0101maputta, studied under him and came to know that teaching too would not guide him of what he is seeking and left him</p>\n<p>5) From the monastery of Uddaka R\u0101maputta to Senani Village in Uruvela, Magadha</p>\n<p>* According to scriptures: After leaving the hermitage of Uddaka, the bodhisatta wandering in stages arrived in beautiful forest grove in Uruvela and decided to settle down there near the river bank of Neranjaana. Then the five group of ascetics   attended to bodhisatta</p>\n<p>6) Striving for enlightenment near the river bank of Neranjana in Uruvela forest (now called Bodh Gaya) from the age 29+ to 35</p>\n<p>According to scriptures this is the period the bodhisatta performed extreme ascetic practice and the five-group of ascetics lived with him hoping to see he gains the enlightenment</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Finding a suitable place to strive</h2>\n<p>This is what the Buddha to be said:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cStill in search, bhikkhus, of what is wholesome, seeking the supreme state of sublime peace, I wandered by stages through the Magadhan country until eventually I arrived at Uruvel\u0101, at Sen\u0101nigama. There I saw an agreeable piece of ground, a delightful grove with a clear-flowing river with pleasant, smooth banks and nearby a village for alms resort. I considered: \u2018This is an agreeable piece of ground; this is a delightful grove with a clear-flowing river with pleasant, smooth banks and nearby a village for alms resort. This will serve for the striving of a clansman intent on striving.\u2019 And I sat down there thinking: \u2018This will serve for striving\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Present day picture of River Neranjana at Bodh Gaya (Uruvela forest grove) picture courtesy:</p>\n<p>You Tube.com</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Acetic Siddhartha looking for a suitable place to meditate -Picture Courtesy: http://nobleclass.weebly.com/buddhism-begins-in-india.html</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Imagination of an Artist: Map showing the route of Ascetic Siddhartha \u2018s wandering from Kapilavttu to Uruvela .

He betook himself for alms, -replete with excellent marks- Bimbis\u0101ra saw him while standing atop his longhouse. Noticing that he was endowed with marks he said the following:</p>\n<p>\u2018Pay heed, sirs, to this one, - handsome, majestic, radiant;</p>\n<p>accomplished in deportment, - he looks just a plough\u2019s length in front.</p>\n<p>Eyes downcast, mindful, - unlike one from a low family.</p>\n<p>Let the king\u2019s messengers run out, - and find where the mendicant will go.\u201d</p>\n<p>Then the king went to the place where the ascetic Siddhartha was, greeted him graciously and said this:</p>\n<p>\u201cYou are just a youth \u2013 a lad in the prime of life.</p>\n<p>You are endowed with beauty and stature, - Like an aristocrat of good birth.</p>\n<p>In glory at the army\u2019s head- surrounded by a troop of elephants.</p>\n<p>I offer you pleasures \u2013 enjoy them! - But please tell me of your birth.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Note: Then the Ascetic Siddhartha refused the royal offer saying: \u201cSeeing the danger in sensual pleasures, - Seeing renunciation as sanctuary, I shall go on to strive; - that is where my mind delights\u201d. This is the first instance we see in the scriptures the reason for going forth. His determination not to go for royal pleasures again- indulge in sensual pleasures- is an important point for a monk or a nun who has gone forth to make a determination, not to abandon the practice for sensual pleasures. The Buddha here guides us that he was able to overcome sensual things for the sake of freedom- It seems like through his experience he is saying to us: As a human being I did it, so you could!</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Ascetic Siddhartha\u2019 s encounter with Teachers \u0100\u1e37\u0101ra K\u0101l\u0101ma and Uddaka R\u0101maputta</h3>\n<p>In Ariyapariyasena sutta (MN:26) the Buddha said to the monks the reasons for his visits to these two teachers:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cHaving gone forth, bhikkhus, in search of what is wholesome, seeking the supreme state of sublime peace, I went to \u0100\u1e37\u0101ra K\u0101l\u0101ma\u2026 (and also to Uddaka R\u0101maputta) \u2026 to lead the holy life in this Dhamma and Discipline\u201d.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Note: * In his teaching the Buddha often mentioned that it is beneficial to lead a holy life under a good teacher and gave a criterion of how to identify a good teacher (see: MN: 95 (Cank\u012b Sutta).</p>\n<p>* Here, the Buddha clearly pointed out that, if you are seeking the spiritual growth and if you do not get the proper guidance under the teacher whom you have selected, you should go out from there- that is what he did- when he was not satisfied with the teachings of the above teachers.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This is what he said about Kalama\u2019s teaching:</p>\n<p>\u201c \u2026 but it occurred to me: \u2018This Dhamma does not lead to \u2026enlightenment, to Nibb\u0101na, but only to reappearance in the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception.\u2019 Not being satisfied with that Dhamma, disappointed with it, I left\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>* About Uddaka\u2019s teaching:</p>\n<p>\u2018This Dhamma does not lead to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to peace, to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibb\u0101na, but only to reappearance in the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception.\u2019 Not being satisfied with that Dhamma, disappointed with it, I left\u201d.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Note: * This show us that the bodhisatta clearly understood that one who attains the above states are is still not free from birth and death but is caught in the trap of M\u0101ra- see: MN: Note: 302, p.1093) * The importance of this is for to understand is that going out of the path in order to attend other attainment are not conducive to a spiritual life. Later we can see how the Buddha pointed out the attainment of deep samadhi and Jahana is the right way to liberation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Ascetic Siddhartha learning under the teacher \u0100\u1e37\u0101ra K\u0101l\u0101ma</p>\n<p>Picture Courtesy: https://elliottelford.com/alara-kalama/</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Gautama Buddha ( as an ascetic) meets the Uddaka R\u0101maputta (left) in one of the bas-reliefs recounting the stages leading up to awakening, Lalitavistara, Borobudur Temple Compounds 8th and 9th century, first corridor, main wall.

While I did so, there was a loud sound of winds coming out from my earholes. Just as there is a loud sound when a smith\u2019s bellows are blown, so too, while I stopped the in-breaths and out-breaths through my nose and ears, there was a loud sound of winds coming out from my earholes. But although tireless energy was aroused in me and unremitting mindfulness was established, my body was overwrought and uncalm because I was exhausted by the painful striving\u2026\u201d.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Extreme ascetic practice of bodhisattva: sculpture by Sri Lankan artist: Tissa Ranasinghe, picture courtesy Divaina.lk</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cS\u0101riputta, I recall having lived a holy life possessing four factors. I have been an ascetic\u2014a supreme ascetic; I have been coarse\u2014supremely coarse; I have been scrupulous\u2014supremely scrupulous; I have been secluded\u2014supremely secluded\u2026 \u201cSuch was my asceticism, S\u0101riputta, that I went naked, rejecting conventions, licking my hands, not coming when asked\u2026 such was my coarseness, S\u0101riputta, that just as the bole of a tinduk\u0101 tree, accumulating over the years, cakes and flakes off, so too, dust and dirt, accumulating over the years, caked off my body and flaked off\u2026 Such was my coarseness, S\u0101riputta, that just as the bole of a tinduk\u0101 tree, accumulating over the years, cakes and flakes off, so too, dust and dirt, accumulating over the years, caked off my body and flaked off\u2026 \u201cSuch was my scrupulousness, S\u0101riputta, that I was always mindful in stepping forwards and stepping backwards. I was full of pity even in regard to a drop of water thus: \u2018Let me not hurt the tiny creatures in the crevices of the ground\u2026 \u201csuch was my seclusion, S\u0101riputta, that I would plunge into some forest and dwell there. And</p>\n<p>when I saw a cowherd or a shepherd or someone gathering grass or sticks, or a woodsman, I would flee from grove to grove, from thicket to thicket, from hollow to hollow\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Note: Showing the extreme of the austerities that he has undergone before his enlightenment the Buddha sharing his experience with the world to show they are not the way for enlightenment. He said thus:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026 but by this racking practice of austerities, I have not attained any superhuman states, any distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones. Could there be another path to enlightenment?\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Through his deep understanding and wisdom, we can see how he abandoned the extreme path and entered into the middle way: showing the importance of practice of deep meditation and attainment of jh\u0101nas:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cI considered: \u2018I recall that when my father the Sakyan was occupied, while I was sitting in the cool shade of a rose-apple tree, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, I entered upon and abided in the first jh\u0101na, which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought, with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion. Could that be the path to enlightenment?\u2019 Then, following on that memory, came the realisation: \u2018That is indeed the path to enlightenment</p>\n<p>Then the Buddha to be pointed out to us that pleasure of deep samadhi- Jhanas bring only wholesome and peace. This is important for mediator, as it shows that the pleasures-bliss come out from deep mediation should not be discard as it is part and partial of the practice. However, he has shown us even those statues also would be abandoned when through the 4th Jahana one gets in to the status of equanimity- the liberation:</p>\n<p>\u201cWith the abandoning of pleasure and pain\u2026I entered upon and abided in the fourth jh\u0101na\u2026But such pleasant feeling that arose in me did not invade my mind and remain\u2026\u201c\u2026I thought: \u2018Why am I afraid of that pleasure that has nothing to do with sensual pleasures and unwholesome states?\u2019 I thought: \u2018I am not afraid of that pleasure since it has nothing to do with sensual pleasures and unwholesome states\u201d</p>\n<p>Note:\u201cThis passage marks a change in the bodhisattva\u2019s evaluation of pleasure; now he no longer regarded it as something to be feared and banished by the practice of austerities. Instead, what is born of seclusion and detachment is seen as a valuable accompaniment of to the higher stages along the path to enlightenment\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>* Then the bodhisatta realizing that he needs physical strength to go in to such deep meditative attunements, commenced eating some food:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026and I ate some solid food\u2014some boiled rice and porridge. Now at that time five bhikkhus were waiting upon me, thinking: \u2018If our recluse Gotama achieves some higher state, he will inform us.\u2019 But when I ate the boiled rice and porridge, the five bhikkhus were disgusted and left me, thinking: \u2018The recluse Gotama now lives luxuriously; he has given up his striving and reverted to luxury.\u2019</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Note: the five group were: Ko\u1e47\u1e0da\u00f1\u00f1a, Bhaddiya, Vappa, Mah\u0101n\u0101ma, and Assaji.  .</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Ascetic Siddhartha and his five attendants in Uruvela forest grove: picture courtesy: Wikimedia Commons</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>We have seen the extreme austerities performed by the Buddha in his six years of ascetic life.

    "page4": "<h1>Section 4: Enlightenment of Buddha Gotama- at Age of 35</h1>\n<p>Tradition says that the Blessed One was enlighten in the year 589 B.C. at Bodh-gaya (then Uruvela) on a full moon day of month of May (Ves\u0101kha -Vesak)   .In this section we are going to focus on some important events prior to and following the noble enlightenment of the Blessed One.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Events Prior to Enlightenment:</h2>\n<p>Earlier (section 3) we have seen how Ascetic Siddhartha gave up his extreme austerities\u2014reflected on his meditative attainments at the age of seven, through his wisdom realised the way for liberation and prepared himself to gain physical strength to achieve it    . By this time the five group of ascetics who were attending to the bodhisatta were not happy about his new mode of practice, left him and went to the Deer Park at Isipatana  . The Bodhisatta stayed in the River Bank of Neranjana, in solitude and resolute, determined to strive for enlightenment! In the following sutta we can see how he defeated Mara and realized the noble state called \u2018superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones\u2019 (alm-ariya nanadassana vesesana)</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Five Great Dreams</h3>\n<p>In the following sutta the Buddha described the five dreams appeared to him before his enlightenment thus:</p>\n<p><em></p>\n<p>\u201cBhikkhus, before his enlightenment, while he was just a bodhisatta, not fully enlightened, five great dreams appeared to the Tath\u0101gata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One. What five?\u201d</p>\n<p></em></p>\n<p>1) he dreamt that this mighty earth was his bedstead; the Him\u0101laya, king of mountains, was his pillow; his left hand rested on the eastern sea, his right hand on the western sea, and his two feet on the southern sea\u2014the dream, represented his awakening to the unsurpassed, perfect enlightenment.</p>\n<p>2) he dreamt that a grass called tiriy\u0101 rose up from his navel and stood touching the sky \u2014the dream showing that he would awaken to the noble eightfold path and would proclaim it well among devas and humans.</p>\n<p>3) he dreamt that white worms with black heads crawled from his feet up to his knees and covered them\u2014the dream showing that many lay followers would follow his teachings.</p>\n<p>4) he dreamt that four birds of different colours came from the four quarters, fell at his feet, and turned all white\u2014the dream showing that members of the four classes\u2014</p>\n<p>khattiyas, brahmins, vessas, and suddas\u2014would go forth from the household life into homelessness and become his disciples.</p>\n<p>5) he dreamt that he climbed up a huge mountain of dung without being soiled by it\u2014the dream showing that he would receive the four requisites to sustain the homeless life  and he would use them without being tied to them, infatuated with them, and blindly absorbed in them, seeing the danger and knowing the escape  .</p>\n<p>Note: These dreams are like foretoken (pubbanimitta) indication that the bodhisatta would gain the Buddhahood in the near future.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Encounters with M\u0101ra</h3>\n<p>On the occasion when the bodhisattva was sitting in meditation under the assattha bo-tree  , in the bank of Neranjana river, M\u0101ra wanted to discourage bodhisattva from attending liberation, wanted to hold him in his grip. Below we can see a passage from Suttanipata, how the M\u0101ra, was trying to persuade the Bodisatta away from Buddhahood.</p>\n<p>The Buddha elaborates this event thus:</p>\n<div id=\"gatha\">\n<p>\u201cAs I strove to subdue myself</p>\n<p>beside the broad Nera\u00f1jar\u0101,</p>\n<p>absorbed unflinchingly to gain</p>\n<p>the surcease of bondage here,</p>\n<p>Namuc\u012b came and spoke to me</p>\n<p>with words all garbed in pity thus:</p>\n</div>\n<p>M\u0101ra</p>\n<div id=\"gatha\">\n<p>\u2018\u2026you are thin and you are pale,</p>\n<p>and you are in death\u2019s presence too:</p>\n<p>a thousand parts are pledged to death</p>\n<p>but life still holds one part of you.</p>\n<p>Live, sir! Life\u2019s the better way;</p>\n<p>you may gain merit if you live,</p>\n<p>come live the life of purity, pour</p>\n<p>libations on the holy fires</p>\n<p>and thus a world of merit gain.</p>\n<p>What can you do by struggling now?</p>\n<p>The path of struggling too is rough,</p>\n<p>and difficult and hard to bear\u2026\u2019</p>\n</div>\n<p>The Bodhisatta replied:</p>\n<div id=\"gatha\">\n<p>O Evil One, O Cousin of the Negligent,</p>\n<p>you have come here for your own ends.</p>\n<p>Now, merit I need not at all.</p>\n<p>Let M\u0101ra talk of merit then,</p>\n<p>to those that stand in need of it.</p>\n<p>For I have faith and energy,</p>\n<p>and I have understanding, too.</p>\n<p>So while I thus subdue myself,</p>\n<p>why do you speak to me of life?</p>\n<p>There is this wind that blows, can dry</p>\n<p>even the rivers\u2019 running streams;</p>\n<p>so while I thus subdue myself,</p>\n<p>why should it not dry up my blood?</p>\n<p>And, as the blood dries up, then bile</p>\n<p>and phlegm run dry, the wasting flesh</p>\n<p>becalms the mind: I shall have more</p>\n<p>of mindfulness and wisdom too,</p>\n<p>I shall have greater concentration.</p>\n<p>For living thus, I come to know</p>\n<p>the limits to which feeling goes.</p>\n<p>My mind looks not to sense-desires:</p>\n<p>Now see a being\u2019s purity\u2026\u201d</p>\n</div>\n<p>Having understood the unshakeable determination of the bodhisattva, and that he has no power to defeat him, with a heavy heart M\u0101ra went away.</p>\n<p><b>Note</b>: * The Dhamma message presented here is that unwavering effort is essential to tread on the spiritual path. The Right Effort (samma vayama), as outlined in the Eightfold Noble Truths, is vital for spiritual growth: right effort to eliminate existing evils, to prevent existing evils from arising, to enhance the existing merits, and to continue to acquire new merits. This is one of the essential factors-helping hand to achieve the goal.</p>\n<p>* Tradition says that in the morning of the day of enlightenment the bodhisatta partook milk rice offered by a maiden named Sujata, daughter of householder of nearby Senani village. Though the scriptures have no record of this event we can see a reference to her in the AN1: 258, the Blessed One declaring: <strong>\u201c\u2026the foremost of my female lay followers in being the first to go for refuge is Suj\u0101t\u0101, daughter of Sen\u0101n\u012b\u201d</strong>. (She offered the bodhisatta his last meal before his enlightenment see: AN: Notes: 139).  . In  Mahaparinibbana sutta (DN:16)there is a statement about alms offering to the Buddha:</p>\n<p><em></p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026that these two alms-givings\u2019 are of very great fruit, of very great result, more fruitful and advantageous than any other. Which two? The one is the alms-giving after eating which the Tath\u0101gata attains supreme enlightenment, the other that after which he attains the Nibbana-element without remainder at his final passing\u201d.</p>\n<p></em></p>\n<p>As we know from the sutta that Cunda offered the last meal. It is not mentioned here that who had offered the first meal? If we go by legend, we can assume that Sujata offered the meal to the Buddha to be before his supreme enlightenment!</p>\n<p>If we ponder little further about the Buddha \u2018s statement regarding Sujata being the foremost lay woman to go for refuge to him, we may see her as the fist woman who paid homage to the Buddha after his enlightenment? AN1 (XIV Foremost Chapter) all the others described there were persons who have gone to the refuge of the Buddha after his enlightenment. In the case of Thapassu and Ballika two brothers mentioned in AN1:248. thus: \u201cBhikkhus, the foremost of my male lay followers in being the first to go for refuge are the merchants Tapussa and Bhallika\u201d. According to Vinaya Pitaka :\u201c\u2026When Tapussa and Bhallika knew that the Buddha had finished his meal, they bowed down with their head at his feet, and said, \u201cSir, we go for refuge to the Buddha and the Teaching. Please accept us as lay followers who have gone for refuge for life.\u201d By means of the double refuge, they became the first lay followers in the world\u201d.    Hence, whether Sujata was paying respect to the bodhisatta and offered him his last meal or she was bowing down to the newly enlightened Buddha and offered him the first meal is uncertain.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Supreme Enlightenment -Samma Sam Bodhi</h2>\n<p>The Bodhisattvas, with a strong determination to attain liberation, increased his velour; through his effort and unwavering heedfulness, he strove and won the battle with M\u0101ra and his tenfold army, and attained the supreme enlightenment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>The Blessed One describes his effort and determination as thus:</h3>\n<p><em></p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026bhikkhus, \u2026I strove indefatigably\u2026 \u2018willingly, let only my skin, sinews, and bones remain, and let the flesh and blood dry up in my body, but I will not relax my energy so long as I have not attained what can be attained by manly strength, energy, and exertion.\u2019 It was by heedfulness that I achieved enlightenment, bhikkhus; it was by heedfulness that I achieved the unsurpassed security from bondage\u2026\u201d.</p>\n<p></em></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Full Enlightenment</h3>\n<p>In the following suttas the Blessed One stated about his enlightenment:</p>\n<p><em></p>\n<p>* \u201c...I am now the Arahant and fully enlightened Buddha, am of the Gotama clan\u2026I became fully enlightened at the foot of an assattha-tree\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>* \u201cThen, bhikkhus, being myself subject to birth\u2026ageing\u2026sickness\u2026death having understood the danger in what is subject to birth, ageing\u2026sickness\u2026death\u2026seeking the unborn\u2026 unageing\u2026 unailing \u2026deathless supreme security from bondage\u2026 I attained the\u2026 supreme security from bondage\u2026 Nibb\u0101na\u2026 I attained the sorrowless\u2026 undefiled\u2026 supreme security from bondage, Nibb\u0101na. The knowledge and vision arose in me: \u2018My deliverance is unshakeable; this is my last birth; now there is no renewal of being.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p></em></p>\n<h3>The Path to Enlightenment</h3>\n<p>After he had become fully enlightened, the Buddha reflected on the path that led to his awakening. As he was dwelling at Uruvel\u0101 on the bank of the river Nera\u00f1jar\u0101 at the foot of the Goatherd\u2019s Banyan Tree he thought:</p>\n<p><em></p>\n<p>\u201cI am indeed freed from that gruelling asceticism! It is good indeed that I am freed from that useless gruelling asceticism! It is good that, steady and mindful, I have attained enlightenment!\u201d</p>\n<p>[add reference]</p>\n<p></em></p>\n<div id=\"gatha\">\n<p>Having known as useless any austerity</p>\n<p>Aimed at the immortal state,</p>\n<p>That all such penances are futile</p>\n<p>Like oars and rudder on dry land,</p>\n<p>By developing the path to enlightenment\u2014</p>\n<p>Virtue, concentration, and wisdom\u2014</p>\n<p>I have attained supreme purity:</p>\n<p>You are defeated, End-maker.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Quote from SN:4: 1 (Austere Practice sutta)</p>\n<p>Note: M\u0101ra is called the End-maker (antaka) because he binds beings to death. (see: SN: Note: 265).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>What is Full Enlightenment? \u2013 Definition of Samma Sambuddha</h2>\n<p>Samma Sam Buddha is one of the nine noble qualities attributed to Tath\u0101gata. The nine qualities are:</p>\n<p><em></p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026the Blessed One is an arahant, perfectly enlightened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, fortunate, knower of the world, unsurpassed trainer of persons to be tamed, teacher of devas and humans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One.\u2019</p>\n<p></em></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>When we see all the nine noble qualities attributed to the Blessed One, we could include all of them in to one term\u2014The Fully Enlightened One (Samma Sam Buddha). We can justify that claim by looking into noble nine qualities mentioned above:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1)  Arahant\u2014accomplished: Arahant: he has been freed from all the defilements of the worldly life; broken the cycle of samsara; abolished rebirth; and worthy of worship and respect from gods and humans</p>\n<p>2) <b>Samma Sam Buddha</b>\u2014 The Fully Enlightened One: he has discovered (buddha) all things rightly ( samm\u0101) and by himself (s\u0101mam), he fully understood the Four Noble Truths; he awakened from the great sleep of delusion; he attained the knowledge of omniscience.</p>\n<p>3)  <b>Vijj\u0101cara\u0146a sampanno</b> -Endowed with clear vision and virtuous conduct:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The scriptures mentioned three kinds of clear vision (knowledges) (te-Vijja\u2014Three knowledges) and also eight kinds of knowledges: Three Knowledges: 1. knowledge of the recollection of past lives (pubbe-niv\u0101s\u0101ussati \u00f1\u0101\u0146a) 2. knowledge of the passing away and reappearance of beings (dibba-cakkhu) 3.  knowledge of destruction of all taints ( \u0101savakkhaya \u00f1\u0101\u0146a)</p>\n<p>Eight kinds of knowledges\u20141-3 as mentioned above, 4.

The four jh\u0101nas</p>\n<p>Note: The Buddha after describing the knowledge and conduct of noble ones said: \u201c\u2026and beyond this there is no further development of knowledge and conduct that is higher or more perfect\u2026\u201d: DN:4.</p>\n<p>4)  Sugata- Sublime: Because he has reached Nibbana through the path of the Arahant, and has been practicing the principles of the Ariya path since his Bodhisattva days, because he has a beautiful form, because he has a beautiful journey, because he has entered the beautiful place of Nibbana, and because he preaches the Dhamma in the voice of Brahma, he is called sublime one-Sugatha</p>\n<p>5)Lokavidu- Knower of the world: he knows the three worlds fully, has seen the world fully, knows the extent of the world, knows how to end the world.</p>\n<p>6) <b>>nuttaro purisadammasarathi</b> -Incomparable leader of men to be tamed: he surpasses the whole world with his noble qualities hence there is no one to compare him (only equal to a another Samma Sam Buddha), he tames men to be tamed with great compassion and highest wisdom.</p>\n<p>7) <b>Sattha deva manussa</b>- Teacher of gods and men: Like the caravan teacher he guides beings across the wildness of samsara safely.</p>\n<p>8) Buddha-Enlightened: he knows the fruit of liberation, awakened from the delusion of the world.</p>\n<p>Note: In the following sutta Buddha elaborate this title:</p>\n<p><em></p>\n<div id=\"gatha\">\n<p>What must be known is directly known,</p>\n<p>What must be developed has been developed,</p>\n<p>What must be abandoned has been abandoned,</p>\n<p>Therefore, brahmin, I am a Buddha.</p>\n<p>\u2018\u2018Abhi\u00f1\u00f1eyya\u1e43 abhi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101ta\u1e43,</p>\n<p>bh\u0101vetabba\u00f1ca bh\u0101vita\u1e43;</p>\n<p>Pah\u0101tabba\u1e43 pah\u012bna\u1e43 me,</p>\n<p>tasm\u0101 buddhosmi br\u0101hma\u1e47a MN:92.</p>\n</div>\n<p></em></p>\n<p>* In the following sutta also we can see why a Fully Enlightened Being is called the Buddha:</p>\n<p>\u201cAs a lovely white lotus</p>\n<p>is not soiled by the water,</p>\n<p>I am not soiled by the world:</p>\n<p>therefore, O brahmin, I am a Buddha.\u201d</p>\n<p>AN:4:36 (Dona sutta)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>9) <b>Bhagava</b> - Blessed: it is the best of the words, finest word, term for veneration and respect, fortunate one, liberated one, developed one.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Going through all those noble qualities we could see that Samma Sam Buddha carry all those traits within him.

A significant thing!  Why is that?</p>\n<p>Appearance of a Buddha in a world is amazing and very rare thing. According to Mah\u00e2pad\u0101na Sutta (DN:14) during the last \u2018ninety-one aeons\u2019 of time period, only seven Buddhas appeared in the world! Buddhas appear at vast intervals of time and rest of the long, long period the world is Buddha-less (abuddhassa)! Because of none appearance of  Buddha the world is merge in darkness of ignorance! Perhaps not a pleasant place to be.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The other important factor is only the fully-enlightened Buddhas are capable of teaching Dhamma: to lead devas and humans towards the freedom from Samsara suffering. According to scriptures time to time Pacceka-Buddhas (solitary buddhas or private buddhas) who are enlightened noble ones appears but they are not able to teach Dahmma or to establish dispensation to flourish Dhamma (which would thrive even after the passing away of a Samma Sam Buddha).</p>\n<p>Samma Sam Buddha is the supreme physician who would attends to worldly illness, through his universal compassion and deep wisdom about the world, he could give proper treatment to cure worldly illness. According to Dhammachakkapavthvana sutta, only the</p>\n<p>Samma Sam Buddha could role the \u2018Wheel of the Dhamma\u2019 \u2014no other being can stop! Once, rolled it would keep on rolling till the dispensation of the Buddha vanished form the earth.</p>\n<p>This encourage and comfort the followers of the Blessed One, that they could still live in an era where the Dhamma proclaimed by the Buddha is available, even now in this 21st century!  We can see that we are fortunate, we have some idea of the Buddha and his teaching and we also established in faith of the Triple Gem to follow the Dhamma. Therefore, we have a choice, either we would follow his guidance, and practice as lay followers and develop wholesome activities in order to live peacefully and happily in this life and lives to come! Or if we have more wisdom and courage, we can be monastics and enhance our spiritual life, extend support to other beings by spreading the good Dhamma, proclaimed by the Blessed One, our Teacher, the Buddha Gotama. That is the only way we can honour and repay the Blessed One who by his own wisdom and effort got break through and showed us the true way. Later in this compilation we can see his untiring service to the world from age 35 to 80, till his final passing away. Samma Sam Buddha is the one who has proper and complete understanding of the entire humanity-the entire world and who could guide beings safely across to the other shore.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Events occurred soon after the Enlightenment</h2>\n<p>In here we would like to present a few selected incidents happened after the Buddha\u2019s attainment of Nibb\u0101na. It is important to have some knowledge of them as we could see how the newly enlightened Buddha faced the world! These things also would keep us alert in the snares of worldly things waiting behind us to take us out from the spiritual path. There is no one in the three worlds who could trap the Samma Sam Buddha into sensual world. However, those who desire to develop spirituality has to be aware of such traps.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Encounters with M\u0101ra and Mara\u2019s daughter\u2019s</h3>\n<p>After the bodhisattva became fully enlightened Buddha, the M\u0101ra again visited the Blessed One when he was dwelling immersed in the bliss of sam\u0101dhi, at Uruvel\u0101 on the bank of the river Nera\u00f1jar\u0101 at the foot of the Goatherd\u2019s Banyan Tree. M\u0101ra was not sure about the bodhisattva\u2019s supreme liberation, so he approached the Buddha and said:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cHaving deviated from the austere practice</p>\n<p>By which men purify themselves,</p>\n<p>Being impure, you think you\u2019re pure:</p>\n<p>You have missed the path to purity\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Blessed One replied:</p>\n<p>\u201cHaving known as useless any austerity</p>\n<p>Aimed at the immortal state,</p>\n<p>That all such penances are futile</p>\n<p>Like oars and rudder on dry land,</p>\n<p>By developing the path to enlightenment\u2014</p>\n<p>Virtue, Sm\u0101dhi, and wisdom\u2014</p>\n<p>I have attained supreme purity:</p>\n<p>You\u2019re defeated, End-maker!\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>At the end, M\u0101ra realising that he is not able to catch the Buddha in his snare, defeated and disappointed went away like a crow, who attacked a piece of stone thinking it was tasty food.</p>\n<p>Daughter\u2019s of M\u0101ra tried to snare the Blessed One</p>\n<p>According to scriptures, M\u0101ra having disappointed and saddened by his defeat went away and sat not far from where the Buddha sat. At this point, his daughters, Ta\u1e47h\u0101, Arat\u012b, and Rag\u0101 came to him and inquired regarding the reason for his dismay and sadness. M\u0101ra said this:</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Arahant, the Fortunate One in the world, \u2026 has gone beyond M\u0101ra\u2019s realm: therefore, I sorrow so bitterly.\u201d</p>\n<p>Then the three daughters assured their father that with their beauty and charm they could catch him:</p>\n<p>\u201c \u2026we will catch him with the snare of lust, as they catch the forest elephant, we will bind him tightly and bring him back, and he will be under your control\u2026\u201d.</p>\n<p>So, the three daughters of M\u0101ra went near the Blessed One and addressed him with sweet and charming voices:</p>\n<p>\u201cWe serve at your feet, ascetic\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>The Blessed One who has gone beyond lust, hate and delusion, did not pay any attention to them. They were so amazed that they could not captured the attention of the Buddha by their beauty, their lustful singing and dancing. They, talked among themselves of their failed actions:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cIf we had assailed with such tactics any ascetic\u2026who was not devoid of lust, either his heart would have burst, or he would have vomited hot blood from his mouth, or he would have gone mad or become mentally deranged\u2026 what our father told us is true\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Failed to trap the Blessed One in their snare, the daughters departed with disappointment.</p>\n<p>At the end of the sutta there is a statement to this effect:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cThey had come to him glittering with beauty-</p>\n<p>Ta\u1e47h\u0101, Arat\u012b, and Rag\u0101-</p>\n<p>But the Teacher swept them away right there</p>\n<p>as the wind, a fallen cotton tuft\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Dhamma lessons to be learn from this event:</h3>\n<p>1) Establishment of Right View is important in the Spiritual Path 2) to understand the uselessness of practicing austerities for spiritual development. Here we can see that from his own experience the bodhisatta, learned to abandon the wrong view as soon as he realised it, he dropped the obscure practice and straighten his right view. This experience cautions us to avoid the wrong views if we wish to develop our spiritual practice and follow the Right View disclosed by the Buddha. If one would wish to enhance the Dhamma, and to blind fold M\u0101ra, one must keep in mind what the Buddha said and practice accordingly.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>By developing the path to enlightenment\u2014</p>\n<p>Virtue, concentration, and wisdom\u2014</p>\n<p>I have attained supreme purity:</p>\n<p>You\u2019re defeated, End-maker!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>M\u0101ra\u2019s three daughters attempt to seduce the Buddha: Picture courtesy: https://au.pinterest.com/</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Peaceful abiding\u2019s soon after the enlightenment</h2>\n<p>According to Vinaya Pitaka   soon after the enlightenment, the Blessed One stayed near the river bank of Neranjana in meditative bliss for seven days in one place and moving to another and spending seven days etc. Summery of that time period is given below:</p>\n<p>First week: Foot of the Bodhi Tree reflecting on Dependent origination.</p>\n<p>Second week: Foot of the Goatherd\u2019s banyan tree where the Buddha had an encounter with a brahmin from a near by village.</p>\n<p>Third week: Foot of the Powderpuff tree, where the Buddha had an encounter with Naga Mucalinda.</p>\n<p>Fourth Week: Foot of the Ape-flower tree, Tapussa and Bhallika offered a meal to the Buddha and became lay followers (taking refuge in Buddha and the Dhamma), also deva\u2019s offering the first almas bowl.</p>\n<p>Fifth week: Foot of the Goatherd\u2019s banyan tree, reflecting on the profundity of the Dhamma, not inclined to teach Dhamma, and invitation of the Bahama Shampti to teach, consented to his invitation, and looking for people to teach.</p>\n<p>Note: * There is no mention of the seventh week, but the VP says \u201cThen, after staying at Uruvel\u0101 for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Benares (to teach the five group of ascetics).</p>\n<p>* However, popular Buddhist Tradition says that soon after his enlightenment, the Blessed One spent seven weeks near the river bank of Neranjana\u2014the place of enlightenment (now called Bodh Gaya): The seven weeks are described thus:</p>\n<p>First week: Under the Bodhi tree. Second week: The Buddha in gratitude to the Bodhi Tree for its support during his enlightenment, gazed at the bodhi tree. This is called \u2018animisa lochana puja\u2019. Following his example, the Buddhists pay respect to the Bodhi tree. Third week: Buddha saw in his mind that devas in the heavens were not sure of his Buddhahood, hence he created a golden bridge in the air and waled up and down. This is called \u2018Ruwan sakmana\u2019. Fourth Week: The Buddha created a beautiful jewelled chamber, sat inside it and meditate; six colours of rays\u2014blue, yellow, red, white, orange and mixture of the five colours.  ( it says each colour represents the noble qualities of the Blessed One: blue=confidence, yellow=holiness, red=wisdom, white= purity, orange=desire lessness and the mixed colour= representing all noble qualities of the Budda. Note: The Buddhist flag displayed by Buddhists during religious ceremonies represent all those colours). Fifth week: Meditating under the Banyan tree, encounter with the three daughters of M\u0101ra.  Sixth week: Meditating under the Midella tree, encounter with Muchalinda Naga. Seventh week: Sat under Rajayatana tree and meditate. After seven weeks of fasting the Buddha received a meal from Tapussa and Bhallika, two merchants. They became the first lay followers. (it says they asked the Buddha to give something to remind them of the Buddha and he gave a lock of his hair- Kesa Datu. The merchants returned home in Burma and made a chetiya called Shwedagon Pagoda (in Rangoon)  .</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Important Dhamma revealed during that period</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>The Cycle of Dependent Origination- Core Teaching of the Buddha</h3>\n<p>Vinaya Pitaka says: \u201csoon after his awakening the Buddha staying at the bodhi tree     experiencing the bliss of liberation from all suffering, was reflecting on Dependent Origination-DP (pat\u012btychcha samupp\u0101da) in forward and reverse order\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026ignorance is the condition for intentional activities; intentional activities are the condition for consciousness; consciousness is the condition for name and form \u2026 this is how there is the origin of this whole mass of suffering. \u2026 this is how there is the end of this whole mass of suffering\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>* In the following sutta we can see how the Blessed One shared his experience and knowledge of DP with his disciples:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cBhikkhus, before my enlightenment, while I was still a bodhisatta\u2026 it occurred to me: \u2018Alas, this world has fallen into trouble, in that it is born, ages, and dies, it passes away and is reborn, yet it does not understand the escape from this suffering [headed by] aging-and-death. When now will an escape be discerned from this suffering [headed by] aging-and-death?\u2019</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026then, bhikkhus, it occurred to me: \u2018When what exists does aging-and-death come to be? By what is aging-and-death conditioned?  Then, bhikkhus, through careful attention, there took place in me a breakthrough by wisdom: \u2018When there is birth, aging-and-death comes to be; aging-and-death has birth as its condition.\u2019</p>\n<p>(meaning is that the penetration of aging-and-death occurred thus, \u201cWhen there is birth, aging-and-death comes to be)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In the same sutta we can see how the Buddha described that all factors of DP: ignorance\u2026etc depending on each other, originating the whole mass of suffering, and when those factors are not there how the suffering cessed. He was showing us how reflecting on this matter the full understanding came to him which led to his awakening:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cOrigination, origination\u2019\u2014thus, bhikkhus, in regard to things unheard before there arose in me vision, knowledge, wisdom, true knowledge, and light\u2026\u201d (cakkhu, \u00f1\u0101\u1e47a, pa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101, vijj\u0101, and \u0101loka)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cThus, with the remainder less fading away and cessation of ignorance comes cessation of volitional formations; with the cessation of volitional formations, cessation of consciousness\u2026. Such is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering. \u201c\u2018Cessation, cessation\u2019\u2014thus, bhikkhus, in regard to things unheard before there arose in me vision, knowledge, wisdom, true knowledge, and light.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Conditioned phenomena in DP above is described in the following sutta thus:</p>\n<p>When this exists that come to be</p>\n<p>With arising of this, that arise.</p>\n<p>When this does not exist, that does not come to be;</p>\n<p>with the cessation of this that ceases</p>\n<p>(imasmi.m sati ida.m hoti;</p>\n<p>imassuppaadaa ida.m uppajjati;</p>\n<p>imasmi.m asati ida.m na hoti;</p>\n<p>imassa nirodhaa ida.m nirujjhati)</p>\n<p>SN12: 49:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>12 Links of the Dependent Origination -Central Concept in Buddhism: Courtesy https://www.reddit.com/r/BuddhistMonastics/comments</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Note: * this is the first time Dependent Origination (DP) is mentioned in the scriptures (per Vinaya Pitaka)</p>\n<p>* In here, the Blessed One uttered his first 3 Udanas\u2019 (heartfelt exclamations) during his reflection on DP: A summary of the 3 Udanas:</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen things become clear to the energetic brahmin who practices absorption: then all his doubts are dispelled, since he understands the natural order and its conditions\u2026ssince he\u2019s understood the end of the conditions\u2026 he defeats the army of the Lord of Death, Like the sun beaming in the sky\u201d</p>\n<p>* Occasionally people who are studying suttas ponder: whether the Budhha\u2019s awakening happened while he was reflecting on DP as mentioned in Vinaya Pitaka?  or the real breakthrough happened on the full understanding of the Four Noble Truths as mentioned in his first discourse? (see: SN56: 11 ( Setting in Motion the Wheel of the Dhamma sutta). Here, what we have to point out is that the night of awakening as a \u2018Fully Enlighted One\u2019 \u2013 by himself through his great insight and deep wisdom, the Blessed One understood all the doctrines in the world. To stress this point we can look in to Sela Sutta (MN: 92) what the Buddha said to Brahamin Sela:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>What must be known is directly known,</p>\n<p>What must be developed has been developed,</p>\n<p>What must be abandoned has been abandoned,</p>\n<p>Therefore, brahmin, I am a Buddha.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cVery frequently, we find that the Buddha expressed His experience of enlightenment in one of two ways, either in terms of having understood the Four Noble Truths, or in terms of having understood the nature of dependent origination. Again, the Buddha has often mentioned that in order to attain enlightenment one has to understand the Four Noble Truths; or similarly, one has to understand dependent origination\u201d.</p>\n<p>Quote from http://www.buddhanet.net/funbud12.htm</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Who is an Arahant?</h3>\n<p>This also the very first time we see in the scriptures defining \u2018who is an arahant?\u2019</p>\n<p>When the newly enlightened Buddha was spending his blissful time around Bodh Gaya, a brahmin from nearby village approached him and inquired of the qualities of a brahmin. The Blessed One described the qualities showing that a real brahmin is not any ordinary brahmin but an arahant:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201c The brahmin who has shut out bad qualities, who is humble, free from flaws, and self-controlled, who has reached final knowledge and has fulfilled the spiritual life\u2014he may rightly proclaim himself a brahmin, having no conceit about anything in the world\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Arahant</p>\n<p>\u201cBhikkhus, \u2026 how is a bhikkhu an arahant? Evil unwholesome states that defile, bring renewal of being, give trouble, ripen in suffering, and lead to future birth, ageing, and death, are far away from him. That is how a bhikkhu is an arahant.\u201d</p>\n<p>( Katha\u00f1ca, bhikkhave, bhikkhu araha\u1e43 hoti? \u0100rak\u0101ssa honti p\u0101pak\u0101 akusal\u0101 dhamm\u0101, sa\u1e43kilesik\u0101, ponobbhavik\u0101, sadar\u0101, dukkhavip\u0101k\u0101, \u0101yati\u1e43, j\u0101tijar\u0101mara\u1e47iy\u0101.

Scriptures mentioned an encounter taken place at that time: a Naga King called Muchalinda, who had seen the Buddha in deep meditation during a heavy storm gave him protection by wrapping his body with his serpent-coils and putting his hood over the head. When the Buddha came out from the meditation and realising what the Naga King did uttered the following Udana showing the important of harmless practice towards all living beings.  This remind us of the Metta Sutta where the Buddha said that \u2018spreading loving kindness to all beings\u2019 is a quality important to tread on the Noble Path.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cSeclusion is bliss for the contented</p>\n<p>Who sees the Teaching that they have learned.</p>\n<p>Kindness to the world is happiness,</p>\n<p>For one who\u2019s harmless to living beings.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Dispassion for the world is happiness,</p>\n<p>For one who overcomes sensuality.</p>\n<p>But removing the conceit \u2018I am\u2019,</p>\n<p>This, indeed, is the highest bliss.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Note: Apart from being harmless, in here we can see some other essential qualities supporting the spirituality such as seclusion, loving kindness (metta) to all, dispassion towards worldly things and abandon of conceit.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Muchalinda Naga giving protection to the Buddha</p>\n<p>12th century Naga-enthroned Buddha Cambodia.</p>\n<p>Picture courtesy: Cleveland Museum of Art: OH, USA.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>To Honour the Dhamma</h2>\n<p>On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Uruvel\u0101 on the bank of the river</p>\n<p>Nera\u00f1jar\u0101 at the foot of the Goatherd\u2019s Banyan Tree just after he had become fully enlightened a reflection arose in his mind thus:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cOne dwells in suffering if one is without reverence and deference. Now what ascetic or brahmin can I honour and respect and dwell in dependence on?... ... I do not see another ascetic or brahmin more perfect in the knowledge and vision of liberation than</p>\n<p>myself, whom I could honour and respect, and on whom I could dwell in dependence\u2026\u201cLet me then honour, respect, and dwell in dependence on this very Dhamma to which I have fully awakened.\u201d</p>\n<p>Note: * Spk assigns this sutta to the fifth week after the enlightenment. The sutta is also at AN II 20-21 with an additional paragraph, see: SN:Notes: 373, p. 550.</p>\n<p>* This shows the great wisdom and humility of the Buddha recognising the greatness of the Dhamma and sharing his experience with his disciples urging them to honour the Dhamma. This is a very important message to Buddhists- to understands the significant of the Dhamma- the teaching, he stressed this point on his last days of life conveying the important message \u2013 saying when the Buddha is no more \u2013 Dhamma will guide everyone. Hence, we Buddhist rely on Dhamma and live and practice according to Dhamma would never fall out from our spiritual path!, see: DN: 16 (Mahaparinibbana sutta)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Dhamma should be revere</p>\n<p>Therefore, one desiring his own good,</p>\n<p>Aspiring for spiritual greatness,</p>\n<p>Should deeply revere the true Dhamma,</p>\n<p>Recollecting the Buddhas\u2019 Teaching</p>\n<p>Quote from: SN6:2</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Profundity of the Dhamma</h2>\n<p>Another significant Dhamma factor revealed during that time the Buddha was pondering of depth of the Dhamma he fathomed during the night of his awakening: understanding the causality (dependent origination) and giving up all attachments (abandoning greed -tanha) which led him to liberation. He reflected thus:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cI have discovered this profound truth, so hard to see, so hard to comprehend. It\u2019s peaceful and sublime, subtle, beyond the intellect, and knowable only to the wise\u2026\u201d  .</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Note: Following his reflection of the depth of the Dhamma, the Buddha felt that ordinary beings who are immersed in sensual pleasures would not be able to understand the realty and was hesitate to teach. This is what he thought:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u2018Enough with teaching the Dhamma</p>\n<p>That even I found hard to reach;</p>\n<p>For it will never be perceived</p>\n<p>By those who live in lust and hate.</p>\n<p>Those dyed in lust, wrapped in darkness</p>\n<p>Will never discern this abstruse Dhamma</p>\n<p>Which goes against the worldly stream,</p>\n<p>Subtle, deep, and difficult to see\u201d</p>\n<p>MN: 26</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Buddha describes the event:</p>\n<p>\u201c \u2026then, bhikkhus, the Brahm\u0101 Sahampati knew with his mind the thought in my mind and he considered: \u2018The world will be lost, the world will perish, since the mind of the Tath\u0101gata, accomplished and fully enlightened, inclines to inaction rather than to teaching the Dhamma.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026then, just as quickly as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm, the Brahm\u0101 Sahampati vanished in the Brahma-world and appeared before me. He arranged his upper robe on one shoulder, and extending his hands in reverential salutation towards me, said:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cVenerable sir, let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma, let the Sublime One teach the Dhamma. There are beings with little dust in their eyes who are wasting through not hearing the Dhamma. There will be those who will understand the Dhamma -arise, victorious hero, caravan leader, Debtless one, and wander in the world. Let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma, there will be those who will understand.\u2019.</p>\n<p>MN:26.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Blessed One replied:</p>\n<p>\u201c \u2018Open for them are the doors to the Deathless, let those with ears now show their faith. Thinking it would be troublesome, O Brahm\u0101, I did not speak the Dhamma subtle and sublime\u2019\u2026 Then Brahma Shampati thinking: \u2018The Blessed One has consented to my request that he teach the Dhamma.\u2019 and after paying homage to me, keeping me on the right, he thereupon departed at once\u201d.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Note: * This is the first occasion Brahma Sahampati, follower of the Blessed One meeting the newly attained Buddha    * The Blessed One with great compassion consented to his request.</p>\n<p>* This incident demonstrates the Noble Qualities of the Buddha. He had the humility -modesty to accept the request of Brahma Sahampati to proclaim the Dhamma for the people who could get immense benefits from hearing the good Dhamma. He also displayed his highest wisdom by accepting a good advice.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Invitation of Brahma Shampati, picture courtesy: https://littledust.org/</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Significant events happened during that time</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h3>First Step towards the establishment of Fourfold Assembly</h3>\n<p>The Fourfold Assembly (catuparis\u0101 in Pali) denotes to the four groups who follow the Buddha\u2019s teaching:  monks, nuns and lay men and women. In the history of dispensation, of the Buddha, we can see that the first stone of the foundation of the Fourfold Sangha was laid during this time.  This is what happened. At that time, two brothers Tapussa and Bhallika, who were travelling from Ukkal\u0101 to Uruvela, near the place of enlightenment, on an advice of a deva, made some food offering to the Buddha. After offering the meal, they paid homage to the Buddha and asked him to accept them as lay followers  .</p>\n<p>Note: In the establishment of the dispensation, the Blessed One knowing the important of disciples of monks and nuns, also encouraged lay followers to be his disciples, for their own enhancement in spirituality and also to support monastic with four requisites which is essential for their survival. We can see that During the time of the Blessed One and after his passing away- up to the present time, due to the unwavering support of lay devotees, the dispensation of the Buddha still continues to grow and shine in the world!</p>\n<p>Tapussa and Bhallika, offering food to the Blessed One-Peshawar Museum: Picture courtesy: Wikipedia.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>First instance of the Devas\u2019 and non-humans paying homage</h2>\n<p>Often scriptures as well as legend bring stories on how devas or non-humans like Naga Kings paying homage to the Blessed One and asking question pertain to Dhamma and or listening to Dhamma discourses given by the Buddha. Earlier we saw how the Naga King Muchalinda paying homage to the Buddha. When the two brothers mentioned above wanted to offer food to the Buddha, the four great kings offered four alms bowls so the Blessed One could take his meal.  . We also witnessed how Brhmma Sahampati honouring the Blessed One and asking him to teach.  This is also a good example to confirm one of the noble qualities of the Buddha: \u2018teacher of humans and devas.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Note: * In this occasion it is mentioned that the Buddhas don\u2019t receive food with their hands, when the Blessed One was thinking of how to take the meal offered by Tapussa and Bhallika, the four great kings offered four crystal bowls. Tradition says through the psychic potency of the Buddha the four bowls became one. This was the first alms bowl Buddha carried * It is important to note that Deva\u2019s recognising Samma Sambuddha as a supreme being of the world and helping the dispensation to enhance.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>With this note we would like to conclude the section-4, pertain to the Enlightenment of the Buddha. In section 13: we will continue the story of Buddha from his first Teaching Tour, first discourse at the age of 35+ to his passing away at the age of 80, how he wandered in and around the \u2018middle country\u2019 of northern part of Jambudipa dedicating 45 years of his noble life teaching Dhamma and guiding people who wanted to be tamed towards freedom from suffering.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u25d9 Summary</p>\n<p>* In this section we saw how the bodhisatta, with his vigour and wisdom defeated M\u0101ra and his army won the supreme Buddha hood.</p>\n<p>* We have also mentioned the Noble qualities of a Fully Enlightened Budda to show why it is important of a Awaken Being to appear in the midst of population who have no knowledge of the true Dhamma.</p>\n<p>* Briefly we have touched the period soon after of the Buddhahood and learned the good Dhamma teaching the Blessed One shown to the world.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>End Notes: Section 4</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The exact date of Buddha's enlightenment is not precisely known, as it predates written records.  It is believed to have occurred in the 6th century BCE. The most widely accepted date is around 563 BCE to 483 BCE, although different Buddhist traditions may have slightly different calculations: https://www.quora.com/</p>\n<p>In this sutta the Buddha said: \u201cI considered: \u2018It is not easy to attain that pleasure with a body so excessively emaciated. Suppose I ate some solid food\u2014some boiled rice and porridge.\u2019 And I ate some solid food\u2014some boiled rice and porridge. Now at that time five bhikkhus were waiting upon me, thinking: \u2018If our recluse Gotama achieves some higher state, he will inform us.\u2019 But when I ate the boiled rice and porridge, the five bhikkhus were disgusted and left me, thinking: \u2018The recluse Gotama now lives luxuriously; he has given up his striving and reverted to luxury.

Sometimes the texts use the word \u201cM\u0101ra\u201d in a metaphorical sense, as representing the inward psychological causes of bondage such as craving and lust and the external things to which we become bound, particularly the five aggregates themselves. But it is evident that the thought world of the suttas does not conceive M\u0101ra only as a personification of humankind\u2019s moral frailty, but sees him as a real evil deity out to frustrate the efforts of those intent on winning the ultimate goal. The proof of this lies in his pursuit of the Buddha and the arahants after their enlightenment, which would not be credible if he were conceived of merely as a psychological projection.

In this section we will highlight some of special qualities of the Blessed One, which he gained by becoming a Fully enlighten being.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Buddha had extraordinary qualities that no other being in the three worlds   possessed. Being a Samma-Sambuddha, one who discovered the \u2018Path to Enlightenment\u2019, he possessed a wide range of special powers and knowledges, some of which were also attained by noble disciples, but some superior knowledges which are only possessed by a fully enlightened being\u2014a Samma Sam Buddha.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Fully Enlightened Buddha: Picture Courtesy: divaina.lk</p>\n<p>Divaina News Paper, Colombi Sri Lanka</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>The Greatness of the Buddha is Unconceivable</h2>\n<p>The supremacy of the Blessed One is unimaginable\u2014 only another Buddha can comprehend the knowledge of a Buddha.The following sutta makes this point:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cThe domain of the Buddhas is an inconceivable matter that one should not try to conceive; one who tries to conceive it would reap either madness or frustration.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>No one in the three worlds can rival the Buddha</h2>\n<p>The following sutta compares the Buddha to a lion. The lion, king of beasts, cannot be surpassed by other animals. In same way, the Blessed One is unsurpassed in this world with its devas, humans and other beings. He was the one who set in motion the Wheel of the Dhamma called the \u2018Brahm\u0101 Wheel\u2019 (great wheel). He taught the pure Dhamma for the benefit of all sentient beings.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201c He is the Blessed One, the Buddha,</p>\n<p>he is the lion unsurpassed; in this world with its devas,</p>\n<p>he set in motion the wheel of Brahm\u0101.</p>\n<p>Thus, those devas and human beings</p>\n<p>who have gone for refuge to the Buddha</p>\n<p>assemble and pay homage to him,</p>\n<p>the great one free from diffidence:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Tamed, he is the best of tamers;</p>\n<p>peaceful, he is the seer among peace-bringers;</p>\n<p>freed, he is the chief of liberators;</p>\n<p>crossed over, he is the best of guides across.\u201d</p>\n<p>Thus, indeed they pay him homage,</p>\n<p>the great one free from diffidence.</p>\n<p>In this world together with its devas,</p>\n<p>there is no one who can rival you,\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cThe Realized One, compassionate for all living creatures, unstintingly offers teaching. Sentient beings revere him, first among gods and humans, who has gone beyond rebirth.\u201d   .</p>\n<h2>The Buddha Possesses Special Knowledges</h2>\n<p>The Buddha has special abilities which came to him at the attainment of Buddhahood. They are called the \u2018Ten Powers\u2019.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201c S\u0101riputta, the Tath\u0101gata has these ten Tath\u0101gata\u2019s powers,  possessing which he claims the herd leader\u2019s place, roars his lion\u2019s roar in the assemblies, and sets rolling the Wheel of Brahm\u0101\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>The Ten Powers</h3>\n<p>1) The Tath\u0101gata understands as it actually is the possible as possible and the impossible as impossible (the power of knowing what is true and what is not true)   .</p>\n<p>2) The Tath\u0101gata understands as it really is the result of the undertaking of kamma past, future, and present in terms of possibilities and causes (the power of understanding kamma and its results of all beings)   .</p>\n<p>3) The Tath\u0101gata understands as it actually is the ways leading to all destinations (the power of knowing rebirths of beings, whether they will be born in a higher realm or a lower one)  .</p>\n<p>4) The Tath\u0101gata understands as it actually is the world with its many and different elements.</p>\n<p>5) The Tath\u0101gata understands as it actually is how beings have different inclinations (he understands that beings are of inferior inclinations and superior inclinations, and that they gravitate towards those who share their own inclinations).</p>\n<p>6) The Tath\u0101gata understands as it actually is the disposition of the faculties of other beings (his knowledge of the superiority and inferiority of beings\u2019 faculties of faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom)   .</p>\n<p>7) The Tath\u0101gata understands as it actually is the defilement, the cleansing, and the emergence in regard to the jh\u0101nas, liberations, sam\u0101dhi, and attainments   .</p>\n<p>8) The Tath\u0101gata recollects his manifold past lives   .</p>\n<p>9) With the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, the Tath\u0101gata sees beings passing away and reappearing, inferior and superior, fair and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate  .</p>\n<p>10) By realising for himself with direct knowledge, the Tath\u0101gata here and now enters upon and abides in the deliverance of mind and deliverance by wisdom that are taintless with the destruction of the taints.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>The Six Unshared Supernormal Knowledges of the Buddha</h3>\n<p>The following supernormal  knowledges are not shared with noble disciples and are called as\u0101dh\u0101rana \u00f1\u0101na: knowledge of the maturity levels of the five spiritual faculties (indriya paropariyatte \u00f1\u0101na)   knowledge of the dispositions and underlying tendencies of beings (\u0101sayanusaya \u00f1\u0101na)   knowledge of the twin miracle (yamakap\u0101tih\u0101ra \u00f1\u0101na)  ; knowledge of the attainment of great compassion (mah\u0101 karun\u0101sam\u0101pattiya \u00f1\u0101na)  ;</p>\n<p>knowledge of omniscience (sabbannuta \u00f1\u0101na)  ; and knowledge of unobstructiveness (an\u0101varana \u00f1\u0101na)   .</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Note:  The Patisambhid\u0101magga described 73 knowledges possessed by the Buddha, 67 shared with his noble disciples. Only the six called as\u0101dh\u0101rana \u00f1\u0101nas  (see above) are unique to the Buddha.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>The Nine Most Important Noble Qualities of the Buddha</h2>\n<p>According to the scriptures, there are innumerable virtues and noble qualities of the Buddha to reflect upon. In the sutta below, we can see an abridged version highlighting nine main qualities. The Buddha said reflecting the noble qualities would bring peace and harmony to the mind.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026Mah\u0101n\u0101ma, you should recollect the Tath\u0101gata thus  : \u2018The Blessed One is an arahant  , perfectly enlightened  , accomplished in true knowledge and conduct  , fortunate  , knower of the world  , unsurpassed trainer of persons to be tamed  , teacher of devas and humans  , the Enlightened One  , the Blessed One  \u2026\u201d.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Note: The Nine Qualities of the Buddha in Pali: \u201caraham samm\u0101-sambuddho, vijj\u0101-carana-sampanno sugato lokavid\u016b, anuttaro purisa-damma-s\u0101rathi satth\u0101 deva-manuss\u0101nam buddho bhagav\u0101.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Blessed One is accomplished, fully enlightened, endowed with clear vision and virtuous conduct, sublime, the knower of worlds, the incomparable leader of men to be tamed, the teacher of gods and humans, enlightened and blessed.</p>\n<h3>Recollecting the Noble Qualities of the Buddha Brings Peace</h3>\n<p>The following sutta elaborates this point:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026When a noble disciple recollects the Tath\u0101gata, on that occasion his mind is not obsessed by lust, hatred, or delusion; on that occasion his mind is simply straight, based on the Tath\u0101gata. A noble disciple whose mind is straight gains inspiration in the meaning, gains inspiration in the Dhamma, gains joy connected with the Dhamma. When he is joyful, rapture arises. For one with a rapturous mind, the body becomes tranquil. One tranquil in body feels pleasure. For one feeling pleasure, the mind becomes concentrated. This is called a noble disciple who dwells in balance amid an unbalanced population, who dwells unafflicted amid an afflicted population.  As one who has entered the stream of the Dhamma, he develops recollection of the Buddha\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>He who found for the sake of all beings release from the snare of death; who revealed the Dhamma, the method, for the benefit of devas and humans; he in whom many people gain confidence when they see and listen to him; the one skilled in the path and what is not the path, the taintless one who accomplished his task; the Enlightened One bearing his final body is called \u201ca great man of great wisdom.\u201d</p>\n<p>Quote from AN4: 35.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>The Buddha is the Great Man with Great Wisdom</h2>\n<p>In this sutta we find a dialogue between brahmin Vassak\u0101ra, the chief minister of Magadha and the Buddha regarding who is the great man with great wisdom. At the end of the discourse, Vassak\u0101ra said that the Blessed One is the great man with great wisdom. Then, the Buddha said thus:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cIndeed, I am practicing for the welfare and happiness of many people; I have established many people in the noble method, that is, in the goodness of the Dhamma, in the wholesomeness of the Dhamma. I think what I want to think and do not think what I do not want to think; I intend what I want to intend and do not intend what I do not want to intend; thus, I have attained to mental mastery over the ways of thought. I gain at will, without trouble or difficulty, the four jh\u0101nas that constitute the higher mind and are pleasant dwellings in this very life. With the destruction of the taints, I have realized for myself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, I dwell in it.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>The Buddha Received Honor and Respect from All Other Beings</h2>\n<p>We can see in the following suttas the reason for the Blessed One being honored and respected:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>* In the Vera\u00f1j\u0101 Sutta (AN8:11), a brahmin of Vera\u00f1j\u0101  approached the Buddha and said:</p>\n<p>\u201c The ascetic Gotama does not pay homage to brahmins who are old, aged, burdened with years, advanced in life, come to the last stage; nor does he stand up for them or offer them a seat\u2026 nor does he stand up for them or offer them a seat.  This is not proper, Master Gotama\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>The Buddha replied:</p>\n<p>\u201cBrahmin, in the world with its devas, M\u0101ra, and Brahm\u0101, in this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its devas and humans, I do not see one to whom I should pay homage, or for whom I should stand up, or whom I should offer a seat. For if the Tath\u0101gata should pay homage to anyone, or stand up for him, or offer him a seat, even that person\u2019s head would split.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>The Blessed One Honoured the Dhamma</h3>\n<p>Soon after his enlightenment, the Buddha was reflecting thus:</p>\n<p>\u201cNow what ascetic or brahmin can I honour and respect and dwell in dependence on?...... I do not see another ascetic or brahmin more perfect in the knowledge and vision of liberation than myself, whom I could honour and respect, and on whom I could dwell in dependence\u2026 \u201cLet me then honour, respect, and dwell in dependence on this very Dhamma to which I have fully awakened.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Devas paying homage to the Buddha: Picture Courtesy: Budusarana News Paper, Sri Lankahttps://www.budusarana.lk/budusarana/</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Devas Paying Homage to the Buddha</h3>\n<p>In the Vinaya Pitaka we read of the four great kings, Sakka and Brahma Sampatti visiting the Buddha in Uruvel\u0101 Kassapa\u2019s hermitage, and paying homage to him.</p>\n<p>There are many suttas in the Samyutta Nikaya (e.g. Devatasmayutta, Devaputtasamyutta, Brhamasmyutta, Sakkasdamyutta and Yakkasamyutta), describing events where Devas, Brahmas, Asuras and Yakkas and other beings visit the Buddha to pay homage to him.</p>\n<h3>The Buddha Receive Homage because He is the Most Senior Being in the World</h3>\n<p>The scriptures described the Buddha as the most senior and eldest person in the world.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026brahmin, in a population immersed in ignorance, become like an egg, completely enveloped, I have pierced the eggshell of ignorance. I am the sole person in the world who has awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment.  So, I am the eldest, the best in the world.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>The Buddha is the Elder in the World</h3>\n<p>The Buddha said:</p>\n<p>\u201cWho has abandoned birth and death, consummate in the spiritual life, in whom there are no taints\u2014 he is the one I call an elder. With the destruction of the taints a bhikkhu is called an elder\u201d.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>The Buddha is Skilful in All Three Deeds</h2>\n<p>The Buddha has mastery of deeds done by body, speech and mind. On one occasion remembering his past life as a king\u2019s chariot-maker the Buddha said:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026then I was skilled in crookedness, faults, and defects in wood. But now I am the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One, skilled in crookedness, faults, and defects of the body; skilled in crookedness, faults, and defects of speech; and skilled in crookedness, faults, and defects of mind\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>The Buddha is the Most Excellent Speaker</h2>\n<p>The Buddha is the best of speakers because he speaks the Truth\u2014the Dhamma his excellent words has helped many hundreds and thousands of beings from bondage.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cKnowledge is the best of things that rise up;</p>\n<p>Ignorance excels among things that fall down;</p>\n<p>The Sa\u1e45gha is the best of things that go forth;</p>\n<p>The most excellent of speakers is the Buddha\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>The Blessed One was the Arouser of the Unarisen Path</h2>\n<p>On one occasion the brahmin Gopaka Moggall\u0101na, approached and asked Venerable \u0100nanda Thera:</p>\n<p>\u201cMaster \u0100nanda, is there any single bhikkhu who possesses in each and every way all those qualities that were possessed by Master Gotama, accomplished and fully enlightened?\u201d</p>\n<p>Venerable \u0100nanda replied:</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026 There is no single bhikkhu, brahmin, who possesses in each and every way all those qualities that were possessed by the Blessed One, accomplished and fully enlightened. For the Blessed One was the arouser of the unarisen path, the producer of the unproduced path, the declarer of the undeclared path; he was the knower of the path, the finder of the path, the one skilled in the path. But his disciples now abide following that path and become possessed of it afterwards\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Wonderful and Marvelous Qualities of the Buddha</h2>\n<p>In Section One of this series, we have seen some of the wonderful and marvellous qualities of the Boddhisatva\u2014the Buddha to be. In the scriptures there are innumerable places pointing out the wonderful and marvellous qualities of the fully awakened Buddha. We have selected a few suttas to elaborate on this point:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In the following sutta the Buddha says:</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Tath\u0101gatas, \u0100nanda, are wonderful and possess wonderful qualities; the Tath\u0101gatas are amazing and possess amazing qualities\u201d .</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>The Buddha Possessed Numerous Psychic Abilities</h3>\n<p>The many psychic powers of the Buddha were called wonderful and marvellous qualities. These abilities varied: being many, he could become one; he appears and disappears; he passes through fences, walls and mountains unhindered as if through air; he sinks into the ground and emerges from it as if it were water; he walks on the water without breaking the surface as if on land; he flies cross-legged through the sky like a bird with wings; he even touches and strokes with his hand the sun and moon, mighty and powerful as they are; and he travels in the body as far as the Brahm\u0101 world.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Buddha\u2019s Great Miracles: Picture courtesy: Kagyu Shenpen Kunchab Buddhist Centre</p>\n<p>https://nobletruth.org/</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Ability to Appear in the Brahm\u0101 World</h3>\n<p>At one time Venerable \u0100nanda approached the Blessed One and asked:</p>\n<p>\u201cVenerable sir, does the Blessed One recall ever having gone to the Brahm\u0101 world by spiritual power with a mind-made body?\u201d</p>\n<p>The Buddha replied:</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen, \u0100nanda, the Tath\u0101gata immerses the body in the mind and the mind in the body, and when he dwells having entered upon a blissful perception and a buoyant perception in regard to the body, on that occasion the body of the Tath\u0101gata rises up without difficulty from the earth into the air. He wields the various kinds of spiritual power: having been one, he becomes many; having been many, he becomes one; \u2026 he exercises mastery with the body as far as the Brahm\u0101 world\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Encounter with a Naga serpent:  Source: the Illustration from \u201cThe Life of the Buddha in Pictures.\u201d Courtesy: Dhammatalks.net</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Performances of Miracle at the Monastery of Uruvela Kassapa</h3>\n<p>In the Vinaya Pitaka it describes   several performances of miracles by the Blessed One at the hermitage of Uruvel\u0101 Kasspa.  It seems such events led to the conversion of Uruvel\u0101 Kassapa, a famous Jatila teacher at that time in Magadha and his two brothers, Nad\u012b Kassapa, and Gay\u0101 Kassapa, who established faith in the Blessed One and became his disciples  . We have selected the following incident: an encounter with a Naga serpent\u2014a venomous dragon king who lived in the \u2018Fire Hut\u2019 of Uruvel\u0101 Kassapa.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Buddha entered the fire hut and prepared a spread of grass. He sat down, crossed his legs, straightened his body, and established mindfulness in front of him. When the dragon saw that the Buddha had entered, he was displeased and emitted smoke.\u201d.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Buddha thought:</p>\n<p>\u201cLet me overpower this dragon, using fire against fire, but without harming it in the slightest way\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Buddha then used his supernormal powers so that he, too, emitted smoke. The dragon, being unable to contain his rage, emitted flames. The Buddha entered the fire element and he, too, emitted flames. With both of them emitting flames, it was as if the fire hut was ablaze and burning. The dreadlocked ascetics gathered around the fire hut, saying:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cThe Great Ascetic is handsome, but the dragon is harming him\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The next morning the Buddha had overcome that dragon, using fire against fire, but without harming it in the slightest way. He put it in his alms bowl and showed it to Uruvel\u0101 Kassapa:</p>\n<p>\u201cHere is your dragon, Kassapa, his fire overpowered by fire.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Note: Here we clearly see that the Buddha has shown his psychic power only on special occasions such as the taming of the serial killer Angulim\u0101la and the great miracle he performed to break the pride of the Sakyas in the city of Kapilavastu.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>* The Only Miracles the Buddha Approved</p>\n<p>In Kevaddha Sutta (DN:11) the Buddha says this to the brahmin Kevaddha who urged the Buddha to perform miracles to gain the faith of people in the city of N\u0101landa.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cKevaddha, this is not the way I teach Dhamma to the monks, by saying:\u2019 Go,</p>\n<p>monks, and perform superhuman feats and miracles for the white-clothed lay-people\u2026</p>\n<p>\u2026Kevaddha, there are three kinds of miracle that I have declared, having realised them by my own insight. Which three? The miracle of psychic power,   the miracle of telepathy  , the miracle of instruction\u2026 \u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Blessed One then warns Kevaddha that the miracle of psychic power and the miracle of telepathy have many dangers, hence he dislikes, rejects and despises them. The only miracle the Blessed One approved of was the miracle of instruction\u2014the ability to transform a person through teaching the Dhamma; when one follows the teaching ardently, one can realise the truth for oneself.</p>\n<p>* Noble Qualities are the True Wonders</p>\n<p>The following stanza is the way the Buddha called attention to the quality he regarded as a true wonder and marvel</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026\u0100nanda, remember this too as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the Tath\u0101gata: Here, \u0100nanda, for the Tath\u0101gata feelings are known as they arise, as they are present,</p>\n<p>as they disappear; perceptions are known as they arise, as they are present, as they disappear; thoughts are known as they arise, as they are present, as they disappear. Remember this too, \u0100nanda, as a wonderful and marvellous quality of the Tath\u0101gata.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>The Marks of the Great Man</h2>\n<p>It is shown in the scriptures that the Buddha had not only great spiritual qualities but also extraordinary physical features. The Lakkha\u1e47a Sutta (DN:30) outlines the thirty-two physical attributes of the Blessed One.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cThere are, monks, these thirty-two marks peculiar to a Great Man, and for that Great Man who possesses them, only two careers are open. If he lives the household life, he will become \u2026a wheel-turning monarch; But if he goes forth from the household life into homelessness, he will become an Arahant, a fully enlightened Buddha\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Note: In the Mahapadana Sutta (DN: 14), it gives a detailed description of the thirty-two marks attributed to the Buddha Vipassi.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>The Thirty-Two (32) Marks of a Great Man</h3>\n<p>(1) He has feet with level tread   (2) On the soles of his feet has the impression of a thousand-spoked wheel. (3) He has projecting heels. (4) He has long fingers and toes   (5) He has soft and tender hands and feet. (6) His hands and feet are net-like   (7) He has high-raised ankles   (8) His legs are like an antelope\u2019s. (9) Standing and without bending, he can touch and rub his knees with either hand. (10) His male organs are enclosed in a sheath. (11) His complexion is bright, the colour of gold. (12) His skin is delicate and so smooth that no dust can adhere to his body.

(19) He is proportioned like a banyan-tree: the height of his body is the same as the span of his outstretched arms, and conversely. (20) His bust is evenly rounded. (21) He has a perfect sense of taste (22) He has jaws like a lion\u2019s. (23) He has forty teeth.  (24) His teeth are even. (25) There are no spaces between his teeth. (26) His canine teeth are very bright. (27) His tongue is very long. (28) He has a Brahm\u0101-like voice, like that of the karav\u012bka-bird. (29) His eyes are deep blue. (30) He has eyelashes like a cow\u2019s.  (31) The hair between his eyes is white and soft like cotton-down    (32) His head is like a royal turban a bulge/ knot on the top of the head</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Some More Evidence from the Scriptures Regarding the Thirty-Two Great Marks</h3>\n<p>In Section Four of this series, we saw the Buddha as the Supreme Being \u2014a Fully Enlightened Buddha possessing all the noble qualities. Many suttas in the Sutta Pitaka describe the Buddha's noble qualities as well as his beautiful body. We have selected a few extracts from the scriptures where the physical bodily qualities of the Blessed One were described:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>* Discovery of Brahmin Student Uttara</p>\n<p>According to the Brahm\u0101yu Sutta (MN:91) the Brahm\u0101yu, sent his student Uttara to verify the report spread about the Buddha in his community as being true or not. He instructed his student to check all the noble qualities and also the so-called thirty-two physical marks attributed to the Buddha. Agreeing to fullfill his teachers wish, Uttara</p>\n<p>followed the Blessed One for seven months like a shadow, never leaving him. At the end of the seven months, he went to his teacher and reported:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026the report that has been spread about Master Gotama is true, sir, and not otherwise; and Master Gotama is one such as this and not otherwise. He possesses the thirty-two marks of a Great Man\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Note: In his report to his teacher, Uttara described the thirty-two physical features of the Blessed One.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>* Confirmation of the Brahmin Sela</p>\n<p>According to the Sela Sutta (MN:92), on one occasion the brahmin Sela, who was a great teacher of that time\u2014Master of the three Vedas\u2026fully versed in the marks of the Great Man\u2026, accompanied by three hundred students met the Blessed One seated in green grove with some of his bhikkhu disciples. He approached the Buddha, exchanged greetings and sat down nearby and looked for the thirty-two marks of a Great Man on the Blessed One\u2019s body, seeing all of them except two. The Blessed One, knowing that doubt occurred in the mind of Sela, performed a feat of supernormal power so the brahmin Sela saw the missing two marks. Then Sela said thus:</p>\n<p>\u201cO perfect in body, well favoured,</p>\n<p>Well fashioned and lovely to behold;</p>\n<p>O Blessed One, golden is your colour,</p>\n<p>And white your teeth; you are strong.</p>\n<p>The features are seen one and all</p>\n<p>That distinguish a man as well born;</p>\n<p>They are all to be found on your body,</p>\n<p>These marks that reveal a Great Man\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>* The Brahmin Dona witnessing the Footprints of the Buddha</p>\n<p>In the Dona Sutta (AN4: 36) describes how the brahamin Dona, who was travelling on the highway between Ukka\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101 and Setavya, saw the thousand-spoked</p>\n<p>wheels of the Blessed One\u2019s footprints, with their rims and hubs, complete in all respects, and thought: \u201cIt is astounding and amazing! These surely could not be the footprints of a human being!\u201d.</p>\n<p>Then Doana saw the Buddha sitting near the foot of a tree, went there and asked the Buddha weather  he was deva or gandhabba or any superbeing. The Blessed One said that he is awaken being\u2014the Buddha.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>* How the Brahmin Student Ambatta\u2019s Doubt Disappeared</p>\n<p>According to the Ambatta Sutta (DN:3), Ambatta the student of the brahamin Pokkharasati was walking with the Buddha and looked out for the thirty-two marks of a Gret Man on the Blessed One\u2019s body., seeing all of them except for two. He was in doubt and perplexity about these two marks. The Buddha, being aware of his doubts, enabled Ambattha tp see those two marks on his body using his psychic powers.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Then Ambattha went to see his teacher and reported thus:</p>\n<p>\u201cSir, he (the Buddha) is as he is reported to be, and he is of such nature and not otherwise. He is possessed of the thirty-two marks of a Great Man, all complete, with none missing\u201d .</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>* The Brahmin B\u0101vari\u2019s Descriptions of how to Recognise the Buddha</p>\n<p>On one occasion the brahmin B\u0101vari, asked his students to go and see the Buddha and ask a question about \u201cwhat is head splitting?\u201d. But first the students wanted to know how to recognize the Buddha, and B\u0101vari said thus:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cThe marks of a Great Man have been handed down in our hymns. Thirty-two have been described, complete and in order. One upon whose body is found these marks of a Great Man has two possible destinies, there is no third. If he stays at home, having conquered this land without rod or sword, he shall govern by principle. But if he goes forth from the lay life to homelessness,he becomes an Awakened One, a perfected one, with veil drawn back, supreme\u201d .</p>\n<p>Then the students went seeking the Buddha and finally met him:</p>\n<p>\u201cAjita saw the Buddha,</p>\n<p>like the sun shining with a hundred rays,</p>\n<p>like the moon on the fifteenth day</p>\n<p>when it has come into its fullness.</p>\n<p>Then he saw his body, in all features.</p>\n<p>Thrilled, he stood to one side and</p>\n<p>asked this question in his mind.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>* The Brahamin So\u1e47ada\u1e47\u1e0da Declaring the Thirty-Two Marks upon the Blessed One</p>\n<p>On one occasion the Buddha arrived in the country of Angha and stayed near by the city of Champa. So\u1e47ada\u1e47\u1e0da, a well-known brahmin of that city, planned to visit the Blessed One. Then his followers heard the news and said it was not fitting for him to go and see Master Gotama, instead Master Gotama should visit him. They gave the following reasons:</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026the Reverend Sonadanda is handsome, good-looking, pleasing, of the most beautiful</p>\n<p>complexion, in form and countenance like Brahm\u0101, of no mean appearance\u2026 He is aged, grown old, venerable, advanced in years, long past his youth, whereas the ascetic Gotama is youthful and newly gone forth as a wanderer. The Reverend Sonadanda is esteemed, made much of, honoured, revered, worshipped by King Seniya Bimbisara \u2026etc.  This being so, it is not proper that he should visit the ascetic Gotama, but rather the ascetic Gotama should visit him\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Then the brahmin So\u1e47ada\u1e47\u1e0da said thus:</p>\n<p>\u201cThis good report has been spread about him: \u201cThis Blessed Lord is an Arahant, a fully-enlightened Buddha, perfected in knowledge and conduct...He bears the thirty-two marks of a Great Man\u2026 Indeed, King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha has gone for refuge to him\u2026 Having come to Gaggara\u2019s lotus-pond, the ascetic Gotama is such a guest, and should be treated as such. Therefore, it is not proper that he should come to us, but rather we should go to him\u201d.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>* King Bimbisara Has Seen the Great Marks of Ascetic Siddhartha</p>\n<p>When the Buddha was just an ascetic wandering in Magadha (see, Section Three), King Bimbisara saw him. This is what the scriptures says:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Buddha went to R\u0101jagaha,</p>\n<p>the Mountainfold of the Magadhans.</p>\n<p>He betook himself for alms,</p>\n<p>replete with excellent marks.</p>\n<p>Bimbis\u0101ra saw him</p>\n<p>while standing atop his longhouse.</p>\n<p>Noticing that he was endowed with marks,</p>\n<p>he said the following:</p>\n<p>\u2018Pay heed, sirs, to this one,</p>\n<p>handsome, majestic, radiant\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A Standing Buddha- Avukana, Sri Lanka: Picture courtesy: Buddha Net</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Buddha\u2019s Feet: Picture courtesy: Buddha Net.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Golden Skin colour of the Buddha: Picture courtesy: Pinterest</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Buddha\u2019s Head: Picture courtesy: Harvard Museum</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>End Notes: Section 5</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Three worlds according to the scriptures are the Brahma world, the Deva world and the Human world.

See: MN: Notes: 182, p. 1081.</p>\n<p>An example of this knowledge is the Buddha\u2019s analysis of kamma. See: MN: Notes: 183, p. 1081.</p>\n<p>The Buddha\u2019s knowledge of the paths leading to hell, the animal realm, the spirit world, the human world, the deva world, and nibb\u0101na. See: AN: Notes: 1984, p. 677.</p>\n<p>See: MN: Notes: 187, p. 1082.</p>\n<p>The \u201cdefilement\u201d (sankilesa) is a state causing deterioration, \u201ccleansing\u201d (vod\u0101na) a state causing excellence, \u201cemergence\u201d (vu\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101na) is both cleansing and the rising out of an attainment. The eight liberations (vimokkh\u0101) are enumerated in MN 77.22 and MN 137.26; the nine attainments (sam\u0101patti) are the four jh\u0101nas, four immaterial attainments, and the cessation of perception and feeling. MN: Notes: 188, p. 1082.</p>\n<p>In MN: 4 (Bhayabherava Sutta) , the Buddha said: \u201c\u2026I recollected my manifold past lives, that is, one birth, two births, three births, four births, five births, ten births, twenty births, thirty births, forty births, fifty births, a hundred births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births, many aeons of world-contraction, many aeons of world-expansion, many aeons of world-contraction and expansion: \u2018There I was so named, of such a clan, with such an appearance, such was my nutriment\u2026\u201d Note: The Buddha can recollect 91 aeons back: see: SN: 42: 9.</p>\n<p>This power is explained in MN: 4.</p>\n<p>With this knowledge the Buddha can recognise the potential of persons who could benefit from his teachings, then he selects the suitable Dhamma subject which would help that person.  If the five faculties (pancha i\u1e45driya): faith, energy, mindfulness, sam\u0101dhi and wisdom are matured, a person can easily comprehend the Dhamma. See: KN: Patisambhid\u0101magga: \u00f1\u0101na katha</p>\n<p>This refers to the understanding of mental dispositions and latent tendencies of a person and accordingly the Buddha delivers suitable teaching to them. See: KN: Patisambhid\u0101magga: \u00f1\u0101na katha.</p>\n<p>This is a unique event in the life of the Buddha where he created two opposite elemental characteristics. On that occasion the Blessed One produced fire from the one part of the body and water from the other part of the body. Six coloured rays emerged from every pore. See: KN: Patisambhid\u0101magga: \u00f1\u0101na katha.</p>\n<p>Through this knowledge the Buddha has great compassion for the welfare of all beings. He sees beings who are immersed in the flood of samsara and extends his unlimited support to help them cross over and be free. This is the reason the Buddha is called \u2018the Great Compassionate One\u2019. See: KN: Patisambhid\u0101magga: \u00f1\u0101na katha.</p>\n<p>This is called \u2018all-knowing\u2019\u2014the Buddha possessed the knowledge of everything that he needed to know about living beings and the world, therefore he is called \u2018the Omniscient One\u2019 (Sarvangnna). With this knowledge the Buddha has the ability to direcrt his mind to any object he wished to know. See: KN: Patisambhid\u0101magga: \u00f1\u0101na katha.</p>\n<p>This means without any obstruction the Buddha can understand everything,.Patisambhid\u0101magga says that this and the knowledge of Omniscience are linked together. See: KN: Patisambhid\u0101magga: \u00f1\u0101na katha.</p>\n<p>Recollection of the Buddha: araham samm\u0101-sambuddho, vijj\u0101-carana-sampanno sugato lokavid\u016b, anuttaro purisa-damma-s\u0101rathi satth\u0101 deva-manuss\u0101nam buddho bhagav\u0101.\u201d</p>\n<p>That Blessed One is such since he is accomplished, fully enlightened, endowed with [clear] vision and [virtuous] conduct, sublime, the knower of worlds, the incomparable leader of men to be tamed, the teacher of gods and men, enlightened and blessed.</p>\n<p>Araham: rid of all impurities and defilements of the mind.

Samma Sambuddha are Pali words which means, \u2018he who has attained enlightenment by his own efforts\u2019. He does so- without a teacher, who has discovered the ancient path to liberation, he teaches Dhamma and establishes a community of followers who follows his teaching, forming and support the establishment of the dispensation (Buddha Sasana)  .</p>\n<p>The Buddhist world also referred to the Buddha in this way. In during their daily chanting the Buddhists, pay homage to the Blessed One like thus:</p>\n<p>\u201cNamotassa Bhagavato Arahato Samm\u0101 Sambuddhassa\u201d</p>\n<p>(Homage to the Blessed One, Accomplished and Fully Enlightened One)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In following suttas described why the Blessed One is called Fully Enlightened One:</p>\n<h3>\u201cBhikkhus, the Tath\u0101gata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One, liberated by non-clinging through revulsion towards form, feeling, perception, volitional formations\u2026 consciousness, through its fading away and cessation, is called a Perfectly Enlightened One\u201d</h3>\n<p></p>\n<h3>In Mah\u00e2pad\u0101na Sutta (DN: 14) the Buddha said:</h3>\n<p>\u201cAnd, monks, in this present fortunate aeon I too have now arisen in the world as a fully-enlightened Buddha\u2026  I am now the Arahant and fully enlightened Buddha, and am of the Gotama clan.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>One time King Pasenadi of Kosala   approached the Blessed One and asked:</h3>\n<p>\u201cDoes Master Gotama too claim, \u2018I have awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment\u2019?</p>\n<p>The Buddha said:</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026I, great king, have awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>In the following sutta the Buddha points out why he was called Samma Sambuddha:</h3>\n<p>\u201cBhikkhus, there are these Four Noble Truths. What four? The noble truth of suffering \u2026 the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering. It is because he has fully awakened to these Four Noble Truths as they really are that the Tath\u0101gata is called the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Noble Qualities of the Fully Enlightened Being</h3>\n<p>\u201cHe has severed craving and become the Enlightened One,</p>\n<p>cleared of all fumes, completely untainted;</p>\n<p>Most worthy of gifts, most mighty of spirits,</p>\n<p>most perfect of persons, beyond estimation;</p>\n<p>The greatest in grandeur, attained the peak of glory:</p>\n<p>The Blessed One is he, and I am his disciple.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Jina</h2>\n<p>The Buddha has called himself \u2018Jina\u201d\u2014 Victor, because he was the conqueror who defeated Mara\u2019s army and won the supreme victory\u2014the Buddhahood. In following suttas described why the Buddha is called Jina.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>One time when the Buddha was travelling towards Benares (Varanasi), \u0100j\u012bvaka Upaka  , seeing the Buddha asked:</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cSir, your senses are clear and your skin is pure and bright. In whose name have you gone forth? Who is your teacher, whose teaching do you follow?\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Buddha replied:</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m the victor, the knower of all. Abandoning all, I\u2019m not soiled by anything.</p>\n<p>Through my own insight, I\u2019m freed by the ending of craving\u2014</p>\n<p>So, who should I refer to as a teacher?

The Buddha said this to the Sangha:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201c Bhikkhus, I am a brahmin  ever accessible to entreaties, open-handed,</p>\n<p>one bearing his last body, an unsurpassed physician and surgeon,</p>\n<p>You are my own legitimate sons, born from my mouth,</p>\n<p>born of Dhamma, fashioned by Dhamma, heirs of Dhamma,</p>\n<p>not heirs of material things\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Brahmin</h3>\n<p>In the scriptures the Buddha often used the word \u2018brahmin\u2019 to referred to himself and his noble disciples who were arahants  .</p>\n<p>* \u201cWhen things become clear to the keen, meditating brahmin, he remains, scattering M\u0101ra\u2019s army, as the sun lights up the sky\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>* \u201cThe brahmin who has shut out bad qualities, who is humble, free from flaws, and self-controlled, who has reached final knowledge and has fulfilled the spiritual life\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>* At one time a monk asked the Buddha of things make one a brahmin.</p>\n<p>The Buddha said:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cThose who, having removed bad things, live always mindful,</p>\n<p>The Buddhas who have destroyed the fetters,</p>\n<p>truly they are br\u0101hma\u1e47as in the world.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>* When a devata realizing that the Buddha has crossed over the samsara he addressed the Buddha as \u2018brahmin\u2019:</p>\n<p>\u201cAfter a long time at last I see</p>\n<p>A brahmin who is fully quenched,</p>\n<p>Who by not halting, not straining,</p>\n<p>Has crossed over attachment to the world\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>*  On one occasion, the Buddha explained who a \u2018brahmin\u2019 is:</p>\n<p>\u201cFor the brahmin there is no task to be done...</p>\n<p>For the brahmin has done what should be done.</p>\n<p>While he has not gained a footing in the river,</p>\n<p>A man will strain with all his limbs;</p>\n<p>But a footing gained, standing on the ground,</p>\n<p>He need not strain for he has gone beyond.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This is a simile for the brahmin, O D\u0101mali,</p>\n<p>For the taintless one, the discreet meditator.</p>\n<p>Having reached the end of birth and death,</p>\n<p>He need not strain for he has gone beyond.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Antimadehadhari</h3>\n<p>Buddha and arahants are noble beings that carry the last body and called Bearer of the Final Body\u2014because they have destroyed all taints, therefore, no rebirth for them  . Following extracts from scriptures shows that the Buddha and Arahant bear the final body.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>* \u201c\u2026a bhikkhu is an arahant, consummate, with taints destroyed, one who bears his final body\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>* \u201cHaving known the exquisiteness of form, the origination of feelings, how perception arises, and where it disappears; having known volitional activities as alien, as suffering, and not as self, truly that bhikkhu who sees rightly, peaceful, delights in the peaceful state. He bears his final body, having conquered M\u0101ra and his mount\u201d.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>* In Samyutta Nikaya (SN:2) related an incident of the Buddha meeting Brahma Deva Gha\u1e6d\u012bk\u0101ra, who was a friend of the Buddha in one of his previous lives   . At the end of the sutta is the following verse showing that both the Buddha and Brahma Deva Gha\u1e6d\u012bk\u0101ra bearing their final bodies:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cSuch was the meeting that took place</p>\n<p>Between those friends from the past,</p>\n<p>both now inwardly developed,</p>\n<p>Bearers of their final bodies\u201d  .</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>* In the following sutta the Buddha affirm that he bears his final body</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cHe who is concentrated, who has crossed the flood,</p>\n<p>and has known the Dhamma with the supreme view,</p>\n<p>whose influxes are destroyed, who bears his final body:</p>\n<p>the Tath\u0101gata is worthy of the sacrificial cake\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>* The Buddha, one who has gone beyond, carries his final body</p>\n<p>\u201c One virtuous, wise, of developed mind,</p>\n<p>Concentrated, mindful, enjoying jh\u0101na,</p>\n<p>For whom all sorrows are gone, abandoned,</p>\n<p>A taint-destroyer bearing his final body\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>* Upali who was a former follower of Niga\u1e47\u1e6dha N\u0101taputta, after hearing the Dhamma became a follower of the Buddha. In his garland of praises, he said thus:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cFree from perplexity, he abides contented,</p>\n<p>spurning worldly gains, a vessel of gladness;</p>\n<p>A human being who has done the recluse\u2019s duty,</p>\n<p>a man who bears his final body;</p>\n<p>He is utterly peerless and utterly spotless:</p>\n<p>The Blessed One is he, and I am his disciple\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>An Unsurpassed Physician and Surgeon- Anuttaro bhisakko sallakatto:</h3>\n<p>This is one of the honorary titles attributed to the Buddha: he who cures the beings who are suffering in samsara, with his noble medicine: the four noble truth, indeed, he is the \u2018Supreme Physician\u2019!</p>\n<p>In the following sutta we can see how the Buddha identified himself as supreme physician:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>* \u201cI am the one whose presence in the world</p>\n<p>Is very rarely come upon,</p>\n<p>I am the Fully Enlightened One,</p>\n<p>I, O brahmin, am the supreme physician\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>* The following quote from the scriptures shows how the Buddha, like a Physician, gives a noble purgative called \u2018the eightfold path\u2019 to beings who were subject to illness of samsara to be free of suffering:</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026bhikkhus, is that noble purgative that always succeeds and never fails, and in dependence on which beings subject to birth are freed from birth; beings subject to old age are freed from old age; beings subject to death are freed from death; beings subject to sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and anguish are freed from sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and anguish\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>* The following two extracts from the scriptures demonstrate to us how the Buddha as a spiritual physician helps beings to cure themselves from the malady of worldly life:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Telak\u0101ni Bhikkhu says that he was relieved from the poison of Samsara through the guidance of the Blessed One</p>\n<p>Dragging it along,</p>\n<p>I\u2019m not free from grief and lamentation.</p>\n<p>Who will free me from bonds in the world,</p>\n<p>so that I may know about awakening?...</p>\n<p>\u2026he taught the supreme path</p>\n<p>for the canceling of these.</p>\n<p>For a long time, it had lain within me;</p>\n<p>for a long time, it was fixed in me:</p>\n<p>the Buddha cast off the knot,</p>\n<p>curing the damage of poison.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Ubbir\u012b, a queen of Pasenadi Kosala who was grieving for the death of her only daughter, was cured by listening to Buddha\u2019s advice.  .</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cOh! For you have plucked the arrow from me,</p>\n<p>so hard to see, stuck in the heart.</p>\n<p>You\u2019ve swept away the grief for my daughter</p>\n<p>in which I once was mired.</p>\n<p>Today I\u2019ve plucked the arrow,</p>\n<p>I\u2019m hungerless, quenched.</p>\n<p>I go for refuge to that sage,</p>\n<p>the Buddha,to his teaching, and to the Sangha.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>* This is what Brahmin Pi\u1e45giy\u0101n\u012b, a true follower of the Buddha said:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026Just as a capable physician might instantly cure one who is afflicted, sick, and gravely ill; so too, sir, whatever one hears of Master Gotama\u2019s Dhamma\u2014discourses, mixed prose and verse, expositions, or amazing accounts\u2014one\u2019s sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and anguish will vanish\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>The Buddha Helped Physically Unwell People</h3>\n<p>The Buddha not only helped beings who were mentally sick, but also addressed the bodily comfort of beings who were physically unwell. In Vinaya Pitaka: Bhesajjakkhandhaka, there is much evidence conforming to this statement  .</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>* The following incident described in the Vinaya Pitaka gives and account of when, the</p>\n<p>Buddha attended on a very sick monk who had been abandoned by the other monks from the community he lived in. This shows how the Buddha taught others by setting an example through his selfless service and acts of compassion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Blessed One attending to a sick monk: Illustration from \u201cThe Life of the Buddha in Pictures.\u201d Courtesy: Dhammatalks.net</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>* On one occasion there was a monk who had dysentery and was lying in his own feces and urine. Just then, as the Buddha was walking about the dwellings with Venerable \u0100nanda as his attendant, he came to the dwelling of this monk  , when he saw his condition, the Buddha went up to him and asked:</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your illness, monk?\u201d \u201cI have dysentery, Sir.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBut don\u2019t you have a nurse?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cWhy don\u2019t the monks nurse you?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t do anything for them.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Then the Buddha said to \u0100nanda, \u201cGo and get some water, \u0100nanda. Let\u2019s give him a wash.\u201d</p>\n<p>After the Buddha washed the sick monk and changed his robes, the monk Tissa was lying in his bed feeling happy. Standing near him the Blessed One knowing that monk Tissa was about to die and that he has the ability to break through, said to him:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u2018Monk, consciousness will depart from you, your body will</p>\n<p>become useless and, like a log, will lie on the ground.\u201d</p>\n<p>( cira\u1e43 vataya\u1e43 k\u0101yo pa\u1e6dhavi\u1e43 adhisessati</p>\n<p>chuddho apetavi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47o nirattha\u1e43'va kali\u1e45gara\u1e43)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>At the end of the discourse the monk Tissa attained arahantship and soon passed away  .</p>\n<p>Taking this incident to teach the monks, the Buddha said thus:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cMonks, you have no mother or father to nurse you. If you don\u2019t nurse one another, who will?  Whoever would nurse me, should nurse one who is sick\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cThe greatest of all gains is health, Nibb\u0101na is the greatest bliss, The eightfold path is the best of paths for it leads safely to the Deathless.\u201d</p>\n<p>Quote from MN:75(M\u0101gandiya sutta)</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>The Buddha not only attended to sick monks, but gave the following guidelines for appointing caregivers, saying that caregivers should have following qualities:</h3>\n<p>1) being capable of preparing medicine 2) knowing what\u2019s beneficial and what\u2019s harmful and being capable of removing what\u2019s harmful and bringing what\u2019s beneficial 3) being able to nurse the sick with a mind of goodwill, not for the sake of worldly gain 4) not being disgusted at having to clean up faeces, urine, spit, or vomit 5) capable of instructing, inspiring, and gladdening the sick person with a Dhamma talk from time to time\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Cakkhum\u0101- One with of Vision</h3>\n<p>This is another title ascribed to the Blessed One. \u2018Cakkhum\u0101 (Pali) men as having eyes or sight\u2014Cleared Eyed One, one who see the spiritual path and insight to attend liberation, according to scriptures one who has seen and penetrated the noble virtue\u2026noble sam\u0101dhi\u2026noble wisdom and noble liberation is called \u2018Cakkhum\u0101- One with vision. In the following sutta the Buddha said thus:</p>\n<p>* \u201cVirtuous behaviour, sam\u0101dhi wisdom, and unsurpassed liberation: these things the illustrious Gotama understood by himself. Having directly known these things; the Buddha taught the Dhamma to the bhikkhus.

Following quote from the scriptures points this out:</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>The Buddha has Four Kind of Self Confidence</h3>\n<p>\u201cBhikkhus, there are these four kinds of self-confidence that the Tath\u0101gata has, possessing which he claims the place of the chief bull, roars his lion\u2019s roar in the assemblies, and sets in motion the brahma wheel    . What four?</p>\n<p>(1) \u201cI do not see any ground on the basis of which an ascetic or brahmin or deva or M\u0101ra or Brahm\u0101 or anyone in the world might reasonably reprove me, saying: \u2018Though you claim to be perfectly enlightened, you are not fully enlightened about these things.\u2019 Since I do not see any such ground, I dwell securely, fearless, and self-confident.</p>\n<p>(2) \u201cI do not see any ground on the basis of which an ascetic or ...anyone in the</p>\n<p>world might reasonably reprove me, saying: \u2018Though you claim to be one whose taints are destroyed, you have not fully destroyed these taints.\u2019 Since I do not see any such ground, I dwell securely, fearless, and self-confident.</p>\n<p>(3) \u201cI do not see any ground on the basis of which an ascetic or \u2026 anyone in the</p>\n<p>world might reasonably reprove me, saying: \u2018These things that you have said to be obstructive are not able to obstruct one who engages in them.\u2019 Since I do not see any such ground, I dwell secure, fearless, and self-confident.</p>\n<p>(4) \u201cI do not see any ground on the basis of which an ascetic or \u2026 anyone in the</p>\n<p>world might reasonably reprove me, saying: \u2018The Dhamma does not lead one who practices it to the complete destruction of suffering, the goal for the sake of which you teach it. Since I do not see any such ground, I dwell secure, fearless, and self-confident\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>The Buddha does not need to hide anything</h3>\n<p>The following quote shows that everything about the Buddha is open, hence he is self-confident:</p>\n<p>\u201c Bhikkhus, there are these four things that the Tath\u0101gata does not need to hide and three things about which he is irreproachable\u2026.</p>\n<p>(1) \u201cBhikkhus, the Tath\u0101gata is one whose bodily behaviour is purifi ed</p>\n<p>(2) \u201cThe Tath\u0101gata is one whose verbal behaviour is purified.</p>\n<p>(3) \u201cThe Tath\u0101gata is one whose mental behaviour is purified.</p>\n<p>(4) \u201cThe Tath\u0101gata is one whose livelihood is purified\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Note: * The four things about which he is irreproachable, are the same as the four things mentioned in the above sutta. * The Mah\u0101sihan\u0101da sutta (MN:12) gives a detailed description of the self-confidence of the Buddha.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\u00c3dicca Bandhu - Kinsman of the Sun</h2>\n<p>\u00c3dicca bandhu is another commonly usedepithet for the Buddha. (Pali: \u00c3dicca= Sun, bandhu=relative). Legends says that the Buddha\u2019s clan the Sakyan clan, was referred to as \u00c3dicca bandhu; hence the Buddha was addressed as \u00c3dicca bandhu.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>In the following sutta the Buddha referred to himself as \u2018Kinsman of the Sun:</h3>\n<p>\u201cRestraint and abandonment, development and protection: these four strivings were taught by the Kinsman of the Sun.

Repeatedly we see him engaged in living dialogue with people from the many different strata of ancient Indian society\u2014with kings and princes, with brahmins and ascetics, with simple villagers and erudite philosophers, with earnest seekers and vain disputants. It is perhaps in this scripture above all others that the Buddha emerges in the role ascribed to him in the canonical verse of homage to the Blessed One as \u201cthe incomparable leader of persons to be tamed, the teacher of gods and humans\u201d.</p>\n<p>Bhikkhu Bodhi.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The most extraordinary attributes of the Buddha as a Teacher were his boundless compassion, great humility and brilliant teaching methods. With those excellent qualities combined with his vast wisdom and psychic ability, the Blessed One was able to guide and transform innumerable humans as well as devas who approached him seeking solace and peace. In the scriptures there is much evidence that even members of other religious sects, though they were not inclined to follow his teaching, had respect for him and even paid tribute to him.</p>\n<p>We have selected a few events from Blessed One\u2019s teaching career to demonstrate this.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Blessed One taught the spiritual life,</p>\n<p>not based on tradition, culminating in nibb\u0101na,</p>\n<p>lived for the sake of</p>\n<p>restraint and abandoning.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This is the path of the great beings,</p>\n<p>the path followed by the great seers.</p>\n<p>Those who practice it</p>\n<p>as taught by the Buddha,</p>\n<p>acting upon the Teacher/s guidance,</p>\n<p>will make an end of suffering.AN:25</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cBhikkhus, this spiritual life is not lived for the sake of deceiving people and cajoling them; nor for the benefit of gain,</p>\n<p>honor, and praise; nor for the benefit of winning in debates; nor with the thought: \u2018Let the people know me thus.\u2019 But</p>\n<p>rather, this spiritual life is lived for the sake of restraint, abandoning, dispassion, and cessation AN25</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>The Buddha and the Brahmin Sundarika Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja:</h2>\n<p>On one occasion the Blessed One, with the simile of the cloth explained to the assembly of monks and lay people how the mind could become impure or pure.

Sitting in that assembly was Brahmin Sundarika Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja who believed in purification by ritual bathing.

The Buddha, then using clear parables and sound reasoning, broke Magandiya's views and vision of the sensual world, allowing him to understand the Dhamma. One of the similes the Buddha gave which helped M\u0101gandiya see things as they are\u2019 was:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cM\u0101gandiya, suppose there was a man born blind who could not see \u2026 He might hear a man with good eyesight saying: \u2018Good indeed, sirs, is a white cloth, beautiful, spotless, and clean!\u2019 and he would go in search of a white cloth. Then a man would cheat him with a dirty soiled garment \u2026 -and he would accept it and put it on, and being satisfied with it, he would utter words of satisfaction thus: \u2018Good indeed, sirs, is a white cloth, beautiful, spotless, and clean!\u2019 What do you think, M\u0101gandiya? When that man born blind accepted that dirty soiled garment, put it on, and being satisfied with it \u2026\u2014did he do so know and seeing, or out of faith in the man with good eyesight?\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>M\u0101gandiya said: \u201cVenerable sir, he would have done so unknowing and unseeing, out of faith in the man with good eyesight.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Buddha said:</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026so too, M\u0101gandiya, the wanderers of other sects are blind and visionless. They do not know health, they do not see Nibb\u0101na, yet they utter this stanza thus: \u2018The greatest of all gains is health, Nibb\u0101na is the greatest bliss.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>After listening to the discourse of the Buddha, faith was established in him and Magandia said:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cI have confidence in Master Gotama thus: \u2018Master Gotama is capable of teaching</p>\n<p>me the Dhamma in such a way that I can come to know health and to see Nibb\u0101na.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>So, we can see how the Buddha using apt similes and firm reasoning gave a wonderful teaching to Magandia who became a faithful disciple and a noble arahant.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>The Buddha and Prince Abhaya</h2>\n<p>The following encounter occurred at Prince Abhaya\u2019s home. We can see again the Buddha\u2019s skilfulness as a teacher and his similes reveals his compassion for all beings.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>One time Prince Abhaya, one of the sons of King Bimbisara of Magadha  , who was a follower of Niga\u1e47\u1e6dha N\u0101taputta   was asked by his teacher to meet the Buddha and refute his doctrine. The method he suggested was to ask the Buddha whether he speaks words disagreeable to others, and if the Buddha agreed, then to ask what the difference was between him and ordinary people. If the Buddha replied that he would not utter speech that which would be disagreeable to others, then Prince Abaya would say to him:</p>\n<p>\u201c \u2026why have you declared that Devadatta is destined for a rebirth in lower realm? \u2026he is angry and displeased by your speech\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>He said to Prince Abhaya, \u201cWhen the recluse Gotama is posed with this two-horned question by you, he will not be able either to throw it up or to gulp it down. (Suggesting that the prince could refute the Buddha that way).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Following the advice of his teacher, Prince Abhaya invited the Blessed One to his home for a meal. After the meal he asked:</p>\n<p>\u201cVenerable sir, would a Tath\u0101gata utter such speech as would be unwelcome and disagreeable to others?\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Buddha replied: \u201cThere is no one-sided answer to that, prince\u201d.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Then the prince said, \u201cThen, venerable sir, the Niga\u1e47\u1e6dhas have lost in this\u201d</p>\n<p>and proceeded to tell the Buddha about his conversation with his teacher.Ythe Buddha then asked:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201c \u2026what do you think prince, this child (pointing to the son of the prince) were to put a pebble in his mouth, what would you do to him?\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The prince replied: \u201cVenerable sir, I would take it out. If I could not take it out at once, I would take his head in my left hand, and crooking a finger of my right hand, I would take it out even if it meant drawing blood. Why is that? Because I have compassion for the child.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Then The Blessed One explained:</p>\n<p>1) that such speech\u2026to be untrue\u2026unbeneficial, and which is also \u2026disagreeable to others: such speech the Tath\u0101gata does not utter\u20262) speech knows to be true and correct but unbeneficial, \u2026and disagreeable to others: such speech the Tath\u0101gata does not utter\u20263) \u2026speech knows to be true, and beneficial, but which is disagreeable to others: the Tath\u0101gata knows the time to use such speech 4) \u2026speech\u2026knows to be untrue, and unbeneficial, but which is welcome and agreeable to others: such speech the Tath\u0101gata does not utter 5) \u2026 speech\u2026knows to be true but unbeneficial, and which is agreeable to others: such speech the Tath\u0101gata does not utter 6) \u2026speech as knows to be true and beneficial, and which is \u2026agreeable to others: the Tath\u0101gata knows the time to use such speech. Why is that? Because the Tath\u0101gata has compassion for beings.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Then Prince Abhaya asked a further question:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cVenerable sir, when learned nobles\u2026and learned recluses, after formulating a question, then go to the Blessed One and pose it, has there already been in the Blessed One\u2019s mind the thought: \u2018If they come to me and ask me thus, I shall answer thus? Or does that answer occur to the Tath\u0101gata on the spot?\u201d</p>\n<p>Knowing that prince was skilled in chariots, the Buddha asked:</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you think, prince? When people come to you and ask: \u2018What is the name of this part of the chariot?\u2019 has there already been in your mind the thought: \u2018If they come to me and ask me thus, I shall answer them thus\u2019? Or does that answer occur to you on the spot?\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>He replied: \u201cVenerable sir, I am well known as a charioteer skilled in the parts of a chariot. All the parts of a chariot are well known to me. That answer would occur to me on the spot.\u201d</p>\n<p>Then Buddha elaborated:</p>\n<p>\u201cSo too, prince, when learned nobles\u2026 learned recluses, after formulating a question, then come to the Tath\u0101gata and pose it, the answer occurs to the Tath\u0101gata on the spot. Why is that? That element of things has been fully penetrated by the Tath\u0101gata, through the full penetration of which the answer occurs to the Tath\u0101gata on the spot.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>After that day, Prince Abahya became an ardent follower of the Buddha and later became a disciple and a noble arahant</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>The Buddha and the Wanderer Vacchagotta</h2>\n<p>During the time of the Buddha views on the origin of the world, existence of a soul, and what happened after death were hotly debated and argued about. The scriptures mention ten of these  .</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>One time the wanderer Vacchagotta approached the Blessed One and asked:</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026does Master Gotama hold any speculative view at all?\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Buddha replied:</p>\n<p>\u201cVaccha, \u2018speculative view\u2019 is something that the Tath\u0101gata has put away. For the Tath\u0101gata, \u2026 has seen this: \u2018Such is material form\u2026 feeling\u2026 perception\u2026 formations \u2026 consciousness, such their origin, such their disappearance\u2026therefore, I say, with the destruction, fading away, cessation, giving up, and relinquishing of all conceiving\u2019s, all iexcogitations, all I-making, mine-making, and the underlying tendency to conceit, the Tath\u0101gata is liberated through not clinging\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Then Vaccha asked:</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen a bhikkhu\u2019s mind is liberated thus, Master Gotama, where does he reappear after death?\u201d</p>\n<p>The dialogue between the Blessed One and Vaccha goes as follows:</p>\n<p>\u201cThe term \u2018reappears\u2019 does not apply, Vaccha.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen he does not reappear, Master Gotama?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe term \u2018does not reappear\u2019 does not apply, Vaccha.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen he both reappears and does not reappear, Master Gotama?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe term \u2018both reappears and does not reappear\u2019 does not apply, Vaccha.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen he neither reappears nor does not reappear, Master Gotama?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe term \u2018neither reappears nor does not reappear\u2019 does not apply, Vaccha.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Not comprehending what the Blessed One said, was saying Vaccha continued:</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026Master Gotama, here I have fallen into confusion, and the measure of confidence I had gained through previous conversation with Master Gotama has now disappeared\u201d.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Blessed One then uses the beautiful simile of \u2018the fire\u2019 to explain what enlightenment means in his dispensation:</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you think, Vaccha? Suppose a fire were burning before you. Would you know: \u2018This fire is burning before me\u2019?\"</p>\n<p>\"I would, Master Gotama.\"</p>\n<p>\u201cIf someone were to ask you, Vaccha: \u2018What does this fire burning before you burn in dependence on?\u2019 \u2014 being asked thus, what would you answer?\"</p>\n<p>Being asked thus, Master Gotama, I would answer: \u2018This fire burns in dependence on fuel of grass and sticks.\u2019\"</p>\n<p>\"If that fire before you were to be extinguished, would you know: \u2018This fire before me has been extinguished\u2019?\"</p>\n<p>\"I would, Master Gotama.\"</p>\n<p>\"If someone were to ask you, Vaccha: \u2018When that fire before you was extinguished, to which direction did it go: to the east, the west, the north, or the south?\u2019 \u2014 being asked thus, what would you answer?\"</p>\n<p>\"That does not apply, Master Gotama. The fire burned in dependence on its fuel of grass and sticks. When that is used up, if it does not get any more fuel, being without fuel, it is reckoned as extinguished.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>When there is a fire burning before the presence of a person, he knows there is a fire; that fire is burning depend on sticks, then the fire has been extinguished because there were no sticks to burn; then someone asked that person what happened to the fire? when it ended up, what direction it went\u2026north or south\u2026etc.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Through the simile of the extinguished fire, the Blessed One showed Vaccha the pointlessness of speculative views. Vaccha became a follower of the Buddha and later, when he attained arahant-hood he praised the Buddha saying:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>became a disciple. When he attained arahant hood, he praised the Buddha thus:</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026the Blessed One has been worshipped by me, the Sublime One has been worshipped by me\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>The Buddha and His Disciples:</h2>\n<p>The following incident shows how his disciples regarded the Buddha as their teacher. It demonstrates the Buddha\u2019s humility and also that his disciples did not worship him as a god or super-human, rather simply a teacher, who discovered the spiritual path and showed it them.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>With Venerable S\u0101riputta</h3>\n<p>On one occasion at the Pav\u0101ra\u1e47\u0101 ceremony  , the Blessed One invited his disciples to point out any misconduct on his part. Venerable S\u0101riputta after paying homage to the Buddha said:</p>\n<p>\u201cVenerable sir, there is no deed of the Blessed One, either bodily or verbal, that we censure\u2026the Blessed One is the originator of the path un-arisen before, the producer of the path unproduced before, the declarer of the path undeclared before. He is the knower of the path, the discoverer of the path, the one skilled in the path. And his disciples now dwell following that path and become possessed of it afterwards\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>The Buddha with Devas and Other beings.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cThe Buddha is the \u2018teacher of devas and humans\u2019 (satth\u0101 devamanuss\u0101na\u1e43), and though squarely established in the human world he (the Buddha) towers above the most exalted deities by reason of his supreme wisdom and perfect purity\u2026the devas usually come to visit the Buddha in the deep stillness of the night, while the rest of the world lies immersed in sleep\u2026sometimes the devas come to recite verses in praise of the Master, sometimes to ask questions\u2026 on approaching they almost always bow down to him in homage, for the Buddha is their spiritual and moral superior\u201d .</p>\n<p>Bhikkhu Bodhi</p>\n<p>The Buddha was accepted by Devas\u2019   Brahmas\u2019   and Yakkas\u2019   as a wise and great teacher who inspired them with his purity and universal knowledge. The following are a few of the encounters the Blessed One had with them:</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>The Buddha and Sakka, Ruler of the Gods:</h3>\n<p>One-time Sakka, ruler of the gods, approached the Blessed One and asked:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u2018why do beings wish to live in peace and harmony yet live in hate, harming one another?\u2019.</p>\n<p>The Buddha replied: \u2018it is due to jealousy and greed that beings live in hate,haraming  one another\u2019.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Sakka did not stopped there but continued to ask questions unravelling a chain of causation. The Buddha continue:</p>\n<p>\u2014 jealousy and greed are due to liking and disliking, liking and disliking arise because of craving; in turn they come to be due to thinking (being preoccupied about their craving); results of thinking is proliferation. When one follows the right way - according to Dhamma - then all proliferations cease to be.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Blessed One pointed out to Sakka the right way leading to the cessation of all proliferation and Sakka understood the Dhamma.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cAnd while he had been speaking in this dialogue, the pure and spotless Dhamma-Eye arose within Sakka, ruler of the gods, and he knew: \u2018Whatever things have an origin must come to cessation\u201d (that is, he entered the stream of the Dhamma).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Sakka was delighted by the Buddha\u2019s teaching and said:</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen the Buddha, and my doubts Are all dispelled, my fears are allayed, and now to the Enlightened One I pay Homage due, to him who\u2019s drawn the dart of craving, to the Buddha, peerless Lord, Mighty hero, kinsman of the Sun! Just as Brahm\u0101\u2019s worshipped by the gods, so likewise today we worship you, Enlightened One, and Teacher unsurpassed, whom none can equal in the human world, or in the heavens, dwelling of the gods!\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Sakka ,the ruler of the devas\u2019 listening to a discourse by the Buddha.

The background story to this episode is as below:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cOne day King \u0100\u1e37avaka of \u0100\u1e37av\u0131\u0304, while on a hunt, was captured by the ferocious yakkha \u0100\u1e37avaka, who threatened to eat him. The king could obtain release only by promising the demon that he would provide him daily with a human victim. First the king sent the criminals from the prison, but when there were no more prisoners, he required every family to provide a child. All the families with children eventually fled to other lands and it became incumbent on the king to offer his own son, the \u0100\u1e37avaka prince  . The Buddha, aware of the impending sacrifice, went to the yakkha\u2019s haunt on the day before the offering was to take place in order to convert the demon from his evil ways. At that time the yakka was attending a meeting in the Himalayas, but the Buddha entered his cave, sat down on the yakkha\u2019s throne, and preached the Dhamma to his ladies of his harem. When the yakkha heard about this, he hastened back to \u0100\u1e37av\u0131\u0304 in a fury and demanded that the Blessed One leave\u201d.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Taming of \u0100\u1e37avaka Yakkha by the Blessed One: Picture courtesy: https://namo.lk/category/tripitaka/sutta/samyuttanikaya/</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u0100lavaka the Yakkha arrived at his dwelling and seeing the Buddha sitting there, he said:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cGet out, ascetic!\u201d.</p>\n<p>The Buddha said: \u201cAll right, friend,\u201d and he went out,</p>\n<p>then the yakkha said: \u201cCome in, ascetic\u201d</p>\n<p>and the Blessed One came in.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Buddha complied with the yakkha\u2019s demands three times because he knew that compliance was the most effective way to soften his mind. But when the yakkha thought to send the Buddha in and out all night long, the Master refused to obey</p>\n<p>saying: \u201cI won\u2019t go out, friend. Do whatever you have to do\u201d.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The yakkha then threated the Buddha:</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll ask you a question, ascetic. If you won\u2019t answer me, I\u2019ll drive you insane or I\u2019ll split your heart or I\u2019ll grab you by the feet and hurl you across the Ganges\u201d.</p>\n<p>The Blessed One who was unshaken by all this said :</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cI do not see anyone in this world, friend, with its devas, M\u0101ra, and Brahm\u0101, in this generation with its ascetics and brahmins, its devas and humans, who could drive me insane or split my heart or grab me by the feet and hurl me across the Ganges. But ask whatever you want, friend\u201d.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Then \u0100\u1e37avaka asked the Buddha questions on truthfulness, wisdom, self-control, generosity, dutifulness, patience and more.  After listening to the Buddha\u2019s replies, he was satisfied and delighted:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cWhy now should I ask this question of the many ascetics and brahmins? Today I have understood the good pertaining to the future life, indeed, for my sake the Buddha came to reside at \u0100\u1e37av\u012b. Today I have understood where a gift bears great fruit\u2026I myself will travel about from village to village, town to town, paying homage to the Enlightened One and to the excellence of the Dhamma.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Tradition says that when the Blessed One teaches he keeps his hands in this gesture; it is called the Dhamma Chakka Mudra\u2014he used it when he was delivering his first sermon at Deer park, Isipathana. Picture courtesy: https://namo.lk/dhammachakkappavattana-sutta/</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>The Buddha and Brahm\u0101 Baka</h3>\n<p>According to scriptures, Brahama Baka after spending many eons in the Brahma world had the wrong view that his position in that realm was superior to others and his life eternal. The Blessed One having seen with his own mind Brahm\u0101 Baka\u2019s mind, out of compassion to him, disappeared from Jeta\u2019s Grove and reappeared in that brahm\u0101 world  .</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Blessed One converse with brahma Baka and at the end of it pointed out that: the life span in the brahma world (even it is very long) is going to end. The Buddha described the previous lives of Baka Brahma and the many good deeds he has done in those former births. At the end of the discourse, brahma Baka changed his wrong view about permanence and bowed down to the Blessed One saying:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cSurely you know this life span of mine;</p>\n<p>The others too you know, thus you\u2019re the Buddha.</p>\n<p>Thus, this blazing majesty of yours</p>\n<p>Illumines even the brahm\u0101 world\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>The Buddha is a Wise Teacher</h2>\n<p>The Buddha as a wise teacher always listened to what others had to say, then, if what they said was reasonable and true, he praised the person and accepted what they said. We can see this in the following stories:</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>The Buddha acknowledges Deva T\u0101yana</h3>\n<p>On one occasion a young deva named T\u0101yana approached the Buddha, paid homage to him and recited verses related to the holy life. The following day the Buddha related to the Sangha his encounter with the young deva T\u0101yana and advised the bhikkhus thus:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026learn T\u0101yana\u2019s verses, bhikkhus\u2026Remember T\u0101yana\u2019s verses\u2026T\u0101yana\u2019s verses are beneficial, bhikkhus, they pertain to the fundamentals of the holy life\u201d.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>The Buddha Praises Bhikkhuni Dhammadinn\u0101</h3>\n<p>One time, Vis\u0101kha   who was non-returner and a lay follower of the Buddha, approached Venerable Bhikkhuni Dhammadinn\u0101, paid homage to her and proceeded to ask her profound Dhamma questions on about identity view and liberation. The Bhikkhuni gave an articulate response to all the questions and impressed Vis\u0101kha went to see the Buddha and related to him the incident with the bhikkhuni. The Blessed One ended by praising the bhikkhuni, endorsing her discourse as the word of Buddha saying:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cThe bhikkhun\u012b Dhammadinn\u0101 is wise, Vis\u0101kha, the bhikkhun\u012b Dhammadinn\u0101 has great wisdom. If you had asked me the meaning of this, I would have explained it to you in the same way that the bhikkhun\u012b Dhammadinn\u0101 has explained it. Such is its meaning, and so you should remember it.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Main Purpose of Buddha\u2019s Teaching was to Help Beings to Free from Suffering</h2>\n<p>According to scriptures we can see that the main purpose of the Buddha\u2019s teaching was to guide beings away from suffering.  He understood human nature and sometimes used unorthodox ways to help them understand the Dhamma for themselves. The following are a few events highlighting the skill and compassion of the Buddha, showing his ability to understand the suffering of other beings and help them find peace.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Kis\u0101 Gotam\u012b besieging the Buddha to bring her dead son back to life.  Picture courtesy: https://www.vridhamma.org/</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>The Story of Bhikkhuni Kis\u0101 Gotam\u012b</h3>\n<p>When the Blessed One was living in S\u0101vatti, Kis\u0101 Gotam\u012b then a lay woman, lived with her poor family in a nearby village. After her marriage, she moved into the home of her rich husband but her life with her wealthy relatives was not so comfortable as she had not given a large dowery to her in-laws. However, later when she gave a birth to a son her life became much easier as she had produced and heir for the family. The little baby son was her world. Tragically, one day, the little son fell ill and died and Kis\u0101 Gotam\u012b berft with sorrow could not accept the reality her son\u2019s death. She carried the dead child here and there asking for a good doctor to cure him.  Her mind had become deranged. One day, seeing the weeping and wailing wildly around, a kind villager pointed her to the Buddha who was living at the Jetavana monastery nearby, telling her that he was a great physician who could cure her son.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>She headed for the monastery and seeing saw the Blessed One, she put her at his</p>\n<p>feet begged him to help her son. The wise and compassionate Buddha saw the satate pf her mind and did not point out the obvious. Instead, in order to help her, he asked her to complete the task of bringing a few mustard seeds, from any household, the only cavet being that it had to be from a home that had known no death. She was so glad to hear that the Blessed One could help cure her son and set off, to the neighbouring village to obtain those mustard seeds.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The family of the first house Kisagotami approached was happy to was happy to give her mustard seeds. Delighted she collected the seeds but stopped to check:</p>\n<p>\u201c has anyone died in your house\u201d.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, they said that their father had died recently in that house. Dismayed but not deterred, Kis\u0101gotam\u012b persisted, going from house to the next \u2014hoping to obtain those mustard seeds. She returned to the Buddha, not having found a single house in the village that had not known death.</p>\n<p>Finally, she understood why the Buddha had asked her to bring mustard seeds form a house where no one had died. It had nothing to do with the mustard seeds. She understood that everyone who was born had to die. She put her dead son in the cremation ground and went back to the Buddha.</p>\n<p>The Blessed One taught her the Dhamma\u2014the truth of reality. She renounced her lay life, became a bhikkhuni, practiced according to the Dhamma and became a disciple of the Blessed One.</p>\n<p>In SN:Bhikkhunisamyutrta we read the verse of Venerable Kis\u0101 Gotam\u012b the arahant, fearlessly facing M\u0101ra the evil on.</p>\n<p>M\u0101ra said:</p>\n<p>\u201cWhy now, when your son is dead,</p>\n<p>Do you sit alone with tearful face?</p>\n<p>Having entered the woods all alone,</p>\n<p>Are you on the lookout for a man?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The bhikkhuni replied:</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve gotten past the death of sons;</p>\n<p>With this, the search for men has ended.</p>\n<p>I do not sorrow, I do not weep,</p>\n<p>Nor do I fear you, friend!\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Then M\u0101ra the Evil One, realizing, \u201cThe bhikkhun\u012b Kis\u0101gotam\u012b knows me,\u201d sad and disappointed, disappeared right there</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Taming Angulim\u0101la -the Serial Killer</h3>\n<p>On one occasion the Blessed One was living at S\u0101vatth\u012b in Jeta\u2019s Grove, there was a serial killer named Angulim\u0101la lived in the thick forest grove of Kosala country. He was collecting 1000 fingers to make a garland for his teacher as an honorarium. At the time the sutta opens he was one short of a thousand and had decided to kill the next person to come along.</p>\n<p>The Buddha saw with his divine eye, that Angulim\u0101la\u2019s mother was on her way to visit her son. The Blessed One knowing that Angulim\u0101la had the supporting conditions for arahantship, intercepted him shortly before his mother was due to arrive. Matricide is one of the five terrible crimes that lead to immediate rebirth in hell. Thus, the Buddha with his universal compassion for both the mother and the son, interceded to prevent Angulim\u0101la from committing this crime. When Angulim\u0101la saw the Blessed One walking along on the forest path; he came running behind the Buddha, thinking to cut a finger to complete his finger garland. Then the Blessed One performed such a feat of supernormal power that the bandit Angulim\u0101la, though running as fast as he could, could not catch up with the Blessed One, who was walking at his normal pace. At that the bandit Angulim\u0101la thought:</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is wonderful, it is marvellous! Formerly I could catch up even with a swift elephant and seize it\u2026 though I am running as fast as I can, I cannot catch up with this recluse who is walking at his normal pace!\u201d</p>\n<p>He stopped and called out to the Blessed One:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cStop, recluse! Stop, recluse!\u201d</p>\n<p>The Buddha replied:</p>\n<p>\u201cI have stopped, Angulim\u0101la, you stop too.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Angulim\u0101la thought, \u201cthese recluses, sons of the Sakyans, speak truth\u2026 but though this recluse is still walking, he says: \u2018I have stopped, Angulim\u0101la, you stop too.\u2026 suppose I question him\u201d and in doing so and asked the Buddha:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cWhile you are walking, recluse, you tell me you have stopped; but now, when I have stopped, you say I have not stopped; I ask you about the meaning: \u2018how is it that you have stopped, and I have not?\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Buddha said thus:</p>\n<p>\u201cAngulim\u0101la, I have stopped forever, I abstain from violence towards living beings; but you have no restraint towards things that live that is why I have stopped, and you have not.\u201d</p>\n<p>Due to his previous good kamma, Angulim\u0101la had the wisdom to understand the Buddha\u2019s words; he realised that the monk before him was the Buddha himself and that he had come to the forest for the express purpose of transforming him. He threw his sword and weapons bowed down at the feet of the Sublime One asked and going for the going forth.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Enlightened One, the Sage of Great Compassion,</p>\n<p>The Teacher of the world with all  its gods,</p>\n<p>Addressed him with these words, \u201cCome, bhikkhu.\u201d</p>\n<p>And that was how he came to be a bhikkhu.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Angulim\u0101la became a great disciple and arahant in the Buddha\u2019s dispensation</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Angulimala running after the Buddha.

Often, he would explain a teaching in detail (vitth\u0101rena). Having introduced his topic with a short statement or synopsis (uddesa), he would then explain it at length (niddesa), analysing it, drawing out its implications, and sometimes attaching a simile (upam\u0101) to reinforce his point. Finally, he would restate the introductory declaration as a conclusion (niggamana), now supported by the entire weight of the foregoing analysis. On other occasions, however, the Buddha would not teach in detail. Instead, he would present the Dhamma briefly (sa\u1e45khittena), offering only a short, sometimes even cryptic, statement charged with profundity but meaning. The Buddha did not teach the Doctrine in this way in order to conceal an esoteric message. He used this technique because it sometimes proved more effective than a detailed elaboration in shaking and transforming the minds of his listeners.</p>\n<p>Although direct explanation of the meaning may have transmitted information more efficiently, the purpose of the teaching is not to convey information but to lead on\u2014 to insight, higher wisdom, and deliverance. By requiring the disciples to reflect upon the meaning and to draw out the implications by sustained inquiry and mutual discussion, the Buddha ensured that his utterance would serve this purpose\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Bhikkhu Bodhi</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>The Blessed One Can Teach in Brief or in Detail</h3>\n<p>The Buddha said:</p>\n<p>\u201cS\u0101riputta, I can teach the Dhamma briefly; I can teach the Dhamma in detail; I can teach the Dhamma both briefly and in detail. It is those who can understand that are rare.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Before preaching the Dhamma to a person or group of people, the Blessed One often pondered whether they would have the capability to understand his teachings. Through his power (indriya paropariyatte \u00f1\u0101na)   to see the maturity levels of the spiritual faculties of others he would choose the subject/s and expound accordingly.  If a person or persons would benefit form a detail discourse with parables and clear meaning then the Buddha would utter such teachings; if a person who has matured spiritual faculties, he would utter a brief Dhamma statement with deep a meaning. Both ways The Blessed One, with his great compassion wanted to help word-lings to understand the Dhamma for the sake of getting out of Samsara and to achieve liberation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Below we show the two styles of teachings of the Blessed One:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Lengthy- Detailed Teachings of the Buddha</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>With Subha the Brahmin Student</h3>\n<p>One-time Subha the brahmin student approached the Blessed One and asked if there were  causes and conditions why humans are seen to be inferior and superior? \u2026for people are seen to be short-lived and long-lived, sickly and healthy, ugly and beautiful, uninfluential and influential, poor and wealthy, low-born and high-born, stupid and wise.</p>\n<p>The Buddha said:</p>\n<p>\u201cStudent, beings are owners of their ashoe ctions, heirs of their actions; they originate from their actions, are bound to their actions, have their actions as their refuge. It is action that distinguishes beings as inferior and superior\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Then the Buddha clarified the statement in detail:</p>\n<p>* Reasons why people are seen to be short-lived or long-lived:</p>\n<p>When a person kills and harms other beings, after passing away he will be born in a bad destination. However, if he were to be reborn in the human world, due to his previous bad actions he will have a short life, but if a person abandoned killing and harming other beings, live with compassion for others, after passing away he will be born in a good destination, but if he would be reborn in human world, due to his previous good actions he will have a long life.</p>\n<p>* Reasons why people are seen to be sick or healthy:</p>\n<p>When a person performed wounding others by hand or a weapon, because of his bad action, after passing away he will reborn in a bad destination, if he reappear in human world, due to his previous bad action he will suffer from bad health, but if a person avoids such bad actions and has compassion for others, after passing away would bereborn in a good destination; if he reappear in human world, due to his previous good action he will shave good health.</p>\n<p>* Reasons for people are seen to be ugly or beautiful/handsome:</p>\n<p>When a person is often angry and hostile in his life, and after passing away he appears in a bad destination, but if he reappear in human world he would be ugly. On the other hand a person is calm, not getting angry and offended, after passing away he will appear in good destination, but if she/he reappear in human world she will be beautiful/ he will be handsome.</p>\n<p>* Reasons for people are seen to be uninfluential or influential:</p>\n<p>If a person has a tendency to be jealous and envious of others, after passing away he would appear in bad destination. But if he reappears in the human world he will be born as uninfluential person/ without any social status. However, a person who lived without jealousy and envy, after his death will appear in good destination, but if he reappears in a human world, he will be born as influential person and would receive honour and respect from others.</p>\n<p>* Reasons why people are seen to be poor or wealthy:</p>\n<p>When a person who is greedy and not generous in his actions, after passing away, appears in a bad destination, but if he reappears in human world, he will be poor, but a person who is generous in his action and support and share with others, after passing away, appears in a good destination, but if he reappears in human world, he will be wealthy.</p>\n<p>* Reasons for people are seen to be low-born or high-born:</p>\n<p>When a person is proud and does not honour one who should be honoured and respect, after passing away, he appears in a bad destination, but if he reappears in human world, he will be low born, but a person who pay respect and homage the one who should be honoured and respect, after passing away he appears in a good destination, but if he reappears in human world, he will be high born.</p>\n<p>* Reasons for people are seen to be wise or foolish:</p>\n<p>When a person does not visit a spiritual teacher and asked about the wholesome actions and unwholesome actions; what to be cultivated and should not be cultivated for a welfare and happiness for this life and life to come, after passing away, he appears in a bad destination, but if he reappears in human world, he would be stupid, but a person visit a spiritual teacher and asked about the wholesome actions and unwholesome actions\u2026 after passing away, he appears in a good destination, but if he reappears in human world, he would be wise.</p>\n<p>Subha understood clearly how the Kamma works and was happy and grateful to the Buddha for his meaningful discourse and became follower</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>With the K\u0101l\u0101mas of Kesaputta</h3>\n<p>The K\u0101l\u0101mas of Kesaputta were a clan known for their intellect. One of the most often quoted teachings of the Buddha was addressed to the K\u0101l\u0101mas on an occasion when the the Blessed One was staying in Kesaputta:</p>\n<p>They approached the Buddha and said:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cBhante, there are some ascetics and brahmins who come to Kesaputta\u2026they explain their own doctrines, but denounce the doctrines of others\u2026 We are perplexed and in doubt, Bhante, as to which of these good ascetics speak truth and which speak falsehood\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Buddha said:</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is fitting for you to be perplexed\u2026to be in doubt. Doubt has arisen in you about a perplexing matter. Come, K\u0101l\u0101mas, do not go by oral tradition, by lineage of teaching, by hearsay, by a collection of scriptures, by logical reasoning, by inferential reasoning, by reasoned cogitation, by the acceptance of a view after pondering it, by the seeming competence [of a speaker], or because you think: \u2018The ascetic is our guru\u2019. But when, K\u0101l\u0101mas, you know for yourselves: \u2018These things are unwholesome; these things are blameworthy; these things are censured by the wise; these things, if accepted and undertaken, lead to harm and suffering,\u2019 then you should abandon them\u201d.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Buddha then explained what was meant by unwholesome. Greed, hatred, and delusion he said were the three unwholesome roots which underlay all immoral conduct and all defiled states of mind. He then asked them:</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you think, K\u0101l\u0101mas? When greed arises in a person, is it for his welfare or for his harm?\u201d</p>\n<p>They replied: \u201cFor his harm, Bhante.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Buddha asked: \u201cK\u0101l\u0101mas, a greedy person, overcome by greed, with mind obsessed by it, destroys life, takes what is not given, transgresses with another\u2019s wife, and speaks falsehood; and he encourages others to do likewise. Will that lead to his harm and suffering for a long time?\u201d</p>\n<p>They replied:</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, Bhante.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This applied to the other unwholesome satates: hate and delusion. Then the Buddha extended his teaching to K\u0101l\u0101mas: describing the other two unwholesome: hate and delusion. He asked them once again whether they thought those things were  harmful and brought suffering and the K\u0101l\u0101mas\u2019 agreed that all unwholesome intentions being about  harm and suffering for a long time.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Then the Blessed One said:</p>\n<p>\u201cThus, K\u0101l\u0101mas, when we said: \u2018Come, K\u0101l\u0101mas, do not go by oral tradition \u2026 But when you know for yourselves: \u201cThese things are unwholesome; these things are blameworthy; these things are censured by the wise; these things, if undertaken and practiced, lead to harm and suffering,\u201d then you should abandon them,\u2019 it is because of this that this was said\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Blessed One continued his discourse and asked them whether non-greed, non-hate and non-delusion are for the benefit of a person, and they affirmed that all wholesome things bring happiness for a longtime to oneself and also to the others. The Buddha then described the benefit of wholesome actions and how the abandoning of unwholesome states leads to one\u2019s own liberation. In this way the Buddha directed the K\u0101l\u0101mas toward Dhamma\u2014that abandoning all greed, hate and delusion is the way to nibbana. By simply by letting them reflect on their own he taught them the Dhamma without their having to blindly believe him.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>At the end of the discourse the K\u0101l\u0101mas venerated the Blessed One and said:</p>\n<p>\u201cExcellent, Bhante! \u2026 We go for refuge to the Blessed One, to the Dhamma, and to the Sa\u1e45gha of bhikkhus. Let the Blessed One consider us lay followers who from today have gone for refuge for life.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Brief but Deep Teachings of the Buddha</p>\n<p>The following encounters demonstrate how the Buddha could express the Dhamma in short and simple words. Though brief, they are loaded with deep dhamma</p>\n<p>To highlight the brief dhamma advice of the Blessed One loaded with deep dhamma, we have selected the following extracts from the scriptures:</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>With Ascetic Bahiya Darichariya</h3>\n<p>In Udana mentioned the story of Bahiya thus:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cAt one time the Gracious One was dwelling near S\u0101vatth\u012b, in Jeta\u2019s Wood, at An\u0101thapi\u1e47\u1e0dika\u2019s monastery. Then at that time B\u0101hiya of the Bark Robe was living near Supp\u0101raka, on the bank of the ocean, being venerated\u2026 when B\u0101hiya, had gone into seclusion, this reflection arose in his mind:</p>\n<p>\u201cAmong those in the world who are Worthy Ones, or have entered the path to Worthiness, I am one of them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Then a devat\u0101, who was a former blood-relative of B\u0101hiya, \u2026 desiring his welfare, knowing with his mind the reflection in the mind of B\u0101hiya went to him\u2026and said:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cYou are certainly not a Worthy One\u2026 This practice of yours is not one whereby you could be a Worthy One\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>When questioned by B\u0101hiya, the Devata described the Worthy One:</p>\n<p>\u201cThere is, B\u0101hiya, in the northern countries a city by the name of S\u0101vatth\u012b. There the Gracious One dwells at the present time\u2026a Perfect Sambuddha\u2026and teaches the Dhamma for attaining Worthiness.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Then B\u0101hiya shaken by the devata\u2019s words, decided to meet the Buddha, starting a long journey and reaching the An\u0101thapi\u1e47\u1e0dika\u2019s monastery. He inquired regarding the Blessed One and the monks told him that the Buddha had gone to the city of S\u0101vatth\u012b on alms round. B\u0101hiya eagerly ran towards the city and saw the Blessed One, approached him, venerated him and asked the Buddha to teach him the Dhamma. Since, the Buddha had already entered the village for alms, he told B\u0101hiya that it was not the proper time to teach.  B\u0101hiya asked three times and each time the Buddha repeated his reply. Yet B\u0101hiya begged for Dhamma.</p>\n<p>The Buddha with his just then saw that B\u0101hiya\u2019s life span was  a very short one, and with great compassion taught him the Dhamma right then and there.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026 B\u0101hiya, you should train yourself thus: In what is seen there must be only what is seen, in what is heard there must be only what is heard, in what is sensed there must be only what is sensed, in what is cognized there must be only what is cognized. This is the way, B\u0101hiya, you should train yourself\u2026in what is seen there will be only what is seen, in what is heard there will be only what is heard, in what is sensed there will be only what is sensed, in what is cognized there will be only what is cognized, therefore, you will not be with that; and since, B\u0101hiya, you will not be with that, therefore, you will not be in that; and since, you will not be in that, therefore, B\u0101hiya, you will not be here or hereafter or in between the two\u2014just this is the end of suffering.\u201d</p>\n<p>Through these words B\u0101hiya\u2019s mind was immediately freed attachment.  B\u0101hiya was killed by a cow shortly after and the Buddha instructed his monks to cremate him and construct a stupa in his honour. The Buddha declared B\u0101hiya D\u0101ruc\u012briya the one quickest to attain direct knowledge</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Bhaiya meeting the Buddha.

That thoughtful one, having known both ends, is not stuck in the middle. He is a great man, I declare, he has escaped the seamstress here.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Notes: * On Seamstress: The Buddha said:  \u201cContact, bhikkhus, is one end; the arising of contact is the second end; the cessation of contact is in the middle; and craving is the seamstress. For craving sews one to the production of this or that state of existence. It is in this way that a bhikkhu directly knows what should be directly known; fully understands what should be fully understood; and by doing so, in this very life he makes an end of suffering\u201d AN6: 61.</p>\n<p>* The Buddha and arahants are great men, because they have escaped the seamstress.</p>\n<p>End Note: Section 7</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, spiritual leader of Tibet.

    "page9": "<h1><h1>Section: 9: Past Lives of the Buddha\t</h1></h1>\n<p>In this section we are focusing on the previous lives of the Buddha and also how he recalls his past lives as a Bodhisattva and rebirths of other beings. Rebirth- previous lives is a central teaching in Buddhism; when someone passes away, he/she will have a rebirth according to actions (Kamma) they have performed in the present life. Good Kamma supports good rebirth in a higher destination and Bad Kamma leads to a rebirth in a lower destination   .</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cAccording to the Buddha\u2019s teaching, all beings except the arahants are subject to \u201crenewal of being in the future\u201d (punabbhava), that is, to rebirth. Rebirth, in the Buddhist conception, is not the transmigration of a self or soul but the continuation of a process, a flux of becoming in which successive lives are linked together by causal transmission of influence rather than by substantial identity. The basic causal pattern underlying the process is that defined by the teaching of dependent origination, which also demonstrates how rebirth is possible without a reincarnating self\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>Quote from Bhikkhu Bodhi</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>The Buddha\u2019s ability to see previous lives</h2>\n<p>According to the scriptures, the Blessed One had many special knowledges known as \u2018The Ten Powers\u2019\u2014dasabala\u2014    and among them were: the power of understanding Kamma and its results\u2014Kamma Vip\u0101ka \u2014 of all beings and the power of knowing rebirths of beings, whether they will be born in a higher realm or a lower one  .</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>The Buddha has the Ability to know Manyfold Past Lives</h3>\n<p>The following extract, uttered by the Blessed One on the night of his enlightenment, describes his experience of recollecting his past lives:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cWhen my concentrated mind was thus purified, \u2026 and attained to imperturbability, I directed it to knowledge of the recollection of past lives. I recollected my manifold past lives, that is, one birth, two births, \u2026 a hundred thousand births, many aeons of world-contraction, many aeons of world-expansion, many aeons of world-contraction and expansion: \u2018There I was so named, of such a clan, with such an appearance, \u2026 such my life-term; and passing away from there, I reappeared elsewhere\u2026 thus, with their aspects and particulars I recollected my manifold past lives.

The Blessed One is practising for the annihilation of families, for the calamity of families, for the destruction of families.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Blessed One replied:</p>\n<p>\u201cI recollect ninety-one aeons back, headman, but I do not recall any family that has ever been destroyed merely by offering cooked alms food Rather, whatever families there are that are rich, with much wealth and property, with abundant gold and silver, with abundant possessions and means of subsistence, with abundant wealth and grain, they have all become so from giving, from truthfulness, and from self-control\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Scriptural Evidence of Previous Births of the Buddha as Bodhisattva</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u25d9 In Kuddaka Nikaya there are 3 texts describing previous lives of the Bodhisattava:</p>\n<p>1) The Great Chronicles of Buddhas (Buddhavamsa): describes the appearance of 25 Fully Enlightened Buddhas, beginning from Buddha Dipankara to Buddha Gotama. This text recounts the story of the Bodhisattva\u2019s first aspiration in the presence of Buddha Dipankara to become a future Buddha; gives details of twenty-four Buddhas who appeared before our Buddha Gotama and finally the appearance of the Buddha Gotama.

Picture courtesy: Wikipedia.</p>\n<p>\u25d9 Apart from the three texts mentioned above, there are other suttas in the Sutta Pitaka showing the previous births of the bodhisattva. According to the scriptures, the Buddha narrated about his previous lives on special occasions such as:  in order to clarify some Dhamma matter or at the request of his disciples. Selected extracts from the scriptures where the Blessed One mentioned his past lives are given below:</p>\n<h3>As an Attendant to Brahma Baka.</h3>\n<p>On one occasion, the wrong view of thinking that his life was permanent had arisen in Brahma Baka.  The Buddha having known the thoughts of the Brahm\u0101 Baka, out of compassion for him appeared in the Brahma world. The Blessed One then explained to the Brahm\u0101 Baka, that his life span would one day also end. On the invitation of the Brahma.</p>\n<p>the Buddha explained to him, his previous rebirths and good work done by him and further said that in one life, brahma was the teacher and the Buddha (as Bodhisattva) was his attendant name Kappa.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cI was your apprentice named Kappa; You thought him intelligent and devout: That was your ancient practice of vow and virtue, Which I recollect as if just waking up.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>As the Brahmin Student Jotip\u0101la during the time of Buddha Kassapa</h3>\n<p>On one occasion the Buddha, walking with large group of Sangha in the Kosalan country saw a place off the main road smiled. Venerable \u0100nanda, seeing the Blessed One\u2019s simile, thought:</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is the reason, what is the cause, for the Blessed One\u2019s smile? Tath\u0101gatas do not smile for no reason.\u201d</p>\n<p>Then he approached the Buddha and asked and him for the reason for his smile. Then the Blessed One said that previously the place was a prosperous town called Vebhalinga, where the monastery of the former Buddha Kassapa was situated. In his narration he said that the chief supporter of the Buddha Kassapa was a potter named Gha\u1e6d\u012bk\u0101ra, who had a good friend the brahmin student Jotipala of the same village.  Gha\u1e6d\u012bk\u0101ra inspired Jotipala to visit the Buddha Kassapa and after listening to the Dhamm, Jotipala then became a disciple of the Buddha. Then the Blessed One said thus:</p>\n<p>\u201cNow, \u0100nanda, you may think thus: \u2018Certainly, someone else was the brahmin student Jotip\u0101la on that occasion.\u2019 But it should not be regarded thus. I was the brahmin student Jotip\u0101la on that occasion.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In Gha\u1e6d\u012bk\u0101ra Sutta (SN2: 50) describes how the potter Gha\u1e6d\u012bk\u0101ra, after passing away as a non-returner, appeared in Brahma world as Brahma Gha\u1e6d\u012bk\u0101ra, and visited the Buddha and said thus:</p>\n<p>\u201cIn the past I was the potter, Gha\u1e6d\u012bk\u0101ra in Veha\u1e37i\u1e45ga\u2026was a lay follower of the Buddha Kassapa\u2026 I was your fellow villager; In the past I was your friend\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>As the Brahmin chaplain of King Mah\u0101vijita</h3>\n<p>On one occasion when the Blessed One was living in Ambalatthika park at Kh\u0101numata village, Brahmin Kutadanta went to see the Buddha and asked how to successfully conduct the triple sacrifice with its sixteen requisites. The Blessed One then narrated the story of King Mah\u0101vijita who lived long time ago. The king wished to perform a big sacrifice, so he consulted his minister-chaplain\u2014 Purohitawho\u2014who  instructed the King how to make the sacrifice with sixteen reasons. The sacrifice the King Mah\u0101vijita performed was without killing any animals but with ghee, oil, butter, curds, honey and molasses. Brahmin Kutadanta rejoiced in the words of the Buddha and inquired in that previous life whether the Buddha was the king or the chaplain. The Blessed One said:</p>\n<p>\u2018I do, Brahmin. I was the Brahmin chaplain who conducted that sacrifice.\u2019</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>As King Mahasudassana, a Wheel-Turning Monarch of Kusavati</h3>\n<p>When the Buddha was at the s\u0101l-grove of Mallas of Kusinara, shortly before his final Nibbana, Venerable \u00c3nanda after paying homage to the Buddha said:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201c Lord, may the Blessed Lord not pass away in this miserable little town of wattle-and-daub, right in the jungle \u2026 there are other great cities such as Campa, Rajagaha, Savatthi\u2026in those places there are wealthy Khattiyas, Brahmins and householders who are devoted to the Tathagata and they will provide for the Tath\u0101gata\u2019s funeral in proper style.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Buddha then related the story of King Mah\u0101sudassana, a wheel-turning monarch, a righteous King, who reigned the Kusinara (then known as Kus\u0101vat\u012b), a well-populated and affluent city with a large kingdom. Concluding the narration, the Blessed One said:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cNow, \u0100nanda, you might think King Mahasudassana at that time was somebody else. But you should not regard it so, for I was King Mahasudassana then\u2026 \u2018See, Ananda, how all those conditioned states of the past have vanished and changed! Thus, Ananda, conditioned states are impermanent, they are unstable, they can bring us no comfort, and such being the case, Ananda, we should not rejoice in conditioned states, we should cease to take an interest in them, and be liberated from them\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>As the Jotipala, son of the chaplain of King Disampati</h3>\n<p>On one occasion when the Blessed One was staying at the Vultures\u2019 Peak of Rajagaha, Pa\u00f1casikha of the gandhabbas came to see him. After paying homage to the Buddha, he told how Brahm\u0101 Sanankum\u0101ra had visited the realm of the Thirty-Three Gods. Then Brahm\u0101 Sanankum\u0101ra said to Sakka and his assembly:</p>\n<p>\u201cFor how long has the Blessed Lord been one of mighty wisdom?\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>He then related a previous birth of the Buddha as the son of the chaplain of King Disampati. When his father passed away, because of his mighty wisdom, he became the king\u2019s great chaplain called \u2018Mah\u0101 Govinda\u2019. After some time, when Mah\u0101 Govinda decided to leave the household life into a homeless life, many of the population including kings of that kingdom followed him and became his disciples. He practiced the four Brahmaviharas and taught his disciples the way to union with the Bahama world.</p>\n<p>After telling the narration of Brahma Sanankum\u0101ra, Pa\u00f1casikha asked the Buddha:</p>\n<p>\u2018Do you remember this, Lord?\u2019</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Buddha replied:</p>\n<p>\u2018I do, Pa\u00f1casikha. At that time, I was the Brahmin, the Great Steward, and I taught those disciples the path to union with the Brahm\u0101-world\u2026 however, Pa\u00f1casikha, that holy life does not lead to disenchantment to dispassion\u2026 to Nibbana, but only to birth in the Brahm\u0101-world, whereas my holy life (as the Buddha) leads unfailingly to disenchantment, to dispassion\u2026to enlightenment, to Nibbana.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>As the Chariot Maker to the King Pacetana</h3>\n<p>Following sutta described another previous life of the Buddha:</p>\n<p>On one occasion, the Blessed One recounted the story of King Pacetana and his chariot maker to the Sangha to point out that who is able to stand the spiritual path and who is not. The story goes like this: The King Pacetana was preparing for a forthcoming war and asked his chariot maker to make pair of wheels for the royal chariot. Then chariot maker began his work and it took him nearly six months to make only one wheel. The King came to see his work and, finding only one wheel was available, told him to hurry up as he was going into the battle in six days\u2019 time. The chariot maker agreed to make the second wheel within the next six days and finished his task. The king was puzzled about the two wheels, he could not see any difference of them. He asked what the difference was between the two wheels and the chariot maker demonstrated the difference of the two wheels this way: first he took the wheel made in six days and rolled it, it went a certain distance and then fell into the ground, however when he rolled the wheel made in six months, it rolled as far as it could go and then stood still on its axle. The king was amazed and wanted to know why the two wheels acted in two different ways. The chariot maker said thus:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201c \u2018The wheel that took six days to finish, lord, has a rim \u2026 spokes \u2026 and a nave that is crooked, faulty, and defective. For this reason, it rolled as far as the momentum carried it and then it wobbled and fell to the ground. But the six months wheel has a rim\u2026 spokes\u2026</p>\n<p>and it has a nave that is without crookedness, faults, and defects. For this reason, it rolled as far as the momentum carried it and then stood still as if fixed on an axle\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Concluding the story, the Buddha told the Sangha that in that life he was King Pacetana\u2019s Chariot maker. The story was narrated by the Blessed One to show the Sangha, that who would succeed in the Dhamma Vinaya and who would not. Like the wheel made only in six days could not roll and stand still, Sangha who are not practicing well and are crooked in body, speech and mind will fall down, but the Sangha who are practicing well and without any crookedness in body, speech and mind will stand tall in the dispensation like the wheel made in six months .</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>As King Makh\u0101deva of Mithil\u0101 and also as King Nimi</h3>\n<p>Once the Blessed One was staying in Makh\u0101deva Mango Grove of Mithil\u0101, when in a certain place, he smiled. Then Venerable \u0100nanda knowing that \u201cTath\u0101gatas do not smile for no reason\u201d asked the Buddha why he was smiling and the Buddha narrated the story of a king named Makh\u0101deva who regained the city of Mithil\u0101 a long time ago. That king was established in Dhamma and observed the Uposatha days. According to the long life span of that time the king Makh\u0101deva ruled the country, because he was reflecting of old age, he asked his barber to tell him if he saw a grey hair on his head. Accordingly, the barber having found a grey hair, informed the King.  Then desiring to enhance his spiritual practice as a homeless ascetic, he gave up the kingdom to his son and said thus:</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026 dear prince, when you too see grey hairs growing on your head\u2026carefully instructing the prince, your eldest son, in kingship, shave off your hair and beard, put on the yellow robe, and go forth from the home life into homelessness. Continue this good practice instituted by me and do not be the last man\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>So, the tradition established by the Bodhisattva as king Makh\u0101deva continued for a long period of time. The last king of the lineage of Makh\u0101deva was King Nimi, who practiced the Dhamma accordingly and having found a grey hair, gave his kingdom to his son and became a homeless ascetic. However, his son Ka\u1e37\u0101rajanaka when old age approached did not go into homeless life and broke the tradition. Then the Buddha said to Venerable \u0100nanda:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201c Now, \u0100nanda, it may be that you think thus: \u2018Certainly, on that occasion someone else was King Makh\u0101deva, who instituted that good practice.\u2019 But it should not be regarded thus. I was King Makh\u0101deva on that occasion. I instituted that good practice and later generations continued that good practice instituted by me. But that kind of good practice does not lead to disenchantment\u2026 to Nibb\u0101na, but only to reappearance in the Brahma-world. But there is this kind of good practice that has been instituted by me now, which leads to complete disenchantment, to dispassion\u2026 to Nibb\u0101na. \u201c\u0100nanda, I say to you: continue this good practice instituted by me and do not be the last man\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>As Brahmin Vel\u0101ma who Gave Great Alms</h3>\n<p>On one occasion the Blessed One gave a discourse to the householder An\u0101thapi\u1e47\u1e0dika   on the proper way to give alms. Then he told a story of a brahmin named Vel\u0101ma who gave great alms of nine types (such as golden bowls\u2026silver bowls) each of a quantity of 84,000. Then the Buddha said:</p>\n<p>\u201cYou might think, householder: \u2018He was someone else, the brahmin Vel\u0101ma who on that occasion gave those great alms offering.\u2019 \u2026but you should not look at it in such a way, I myself was the brahmin Vel\u0101ma\u2026 now, householder, at those alms offering there was no one worthy of offerings, no one who purified the offering. Even more fruitful than the great alms offering that the brahmin Vel\u0101ma gave would it be to feed one person accomplished in view\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Following sutta, describes, during his past lives the Buddha has performed many wholesome deeds. Because of those good kamma, he was endowed with thirty-two great marks.</h3>\n<p>Monks, in whatever former life, former existence or dwelling-place the Tathagata, being born a human being, undertook mighty deeds to good purpose, unwavering in good conduct of body, speech and thought, in generosity, self-discipline, observance of the fast-day, in honouring parents, ascetics and Brahmins and the head of the clan, and in other highly meritorious acts; by performing that kamma, heaping it up, lavishly and abundantly, at the breaking-up of the body after death he was reborn in a happy state, in a heavenly world, where he was endowed beyond other devas in ten respects: in length of heavenly life, beauty, happiness, splendour, influence, and in heavenly sights, sounds, smells, tastes and contacts. Falling away from there and coming to be reborn here on earth, he acquired this mark of the Great Man: feet with level tread, so that he places his foot evenly on the ground, lifts it evenly, and touches the ground evenly with the entire sole\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Previous Lives of Other Beings</h2>\n<p>Occasionally, the Blessed One has also narrated the previous lives of other beings. Some selected stories are given below.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Lives of Five Buddhas\u2019 who Appeared in the World Before the Buddha Gotama</h3>\n<p>On one occasion, the Bhikkhu Sangha who were residing at An\u0101thapindika\u2019s park in the Jeta Grove, gathered in the Dhamma hall after the meal to discuss former lives. The Blessed One then approached them and inquired what kind of discussion they were having. When the Sangha told him of their talk, the Buddfha asked whether they would like to hear a discourse on past lives and the Sangha consented.</p>\n<p>In the discourse, the Buddha described that during ninty-one aeons there appeared seven fully enlightened Buddhas in the following order: 91 aeons ago the Buddha Vipass\u012b arose, 31 aeons ago the Buddha Vessabh\u016b arose, in the present aeon there were five Buddhas Kakusandha, Konagamana, Kassapa.  Then as the sixth one Buddha Gotama- the Blessed One arose. The sutta gives details of previous Buddhas: their family, enlightenment, names of chief disciples etc.  Afterwards, the monks discussed about the great psychic abilities of the Buddha:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026 it is marvellous, friends, it is wonderful, the Tath\u0101gata\u2019s great power and ability \u2014 the way he recalls past Buddhas who have gained Parinibb\u0101na... their birth\u2026 name, \u2026 clan, their life-span, the disciples and assemblies connected with him. Well now, friends, how did the Tathagata come by the penetrative knowledge through which he remembers all this ... ? Did some deva reveal this knowledge to him?\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Then the Buddha, after leaving his seclusion approached them and inquired, \u2018what was your conversation as you sat together? What discussion did I interrupt?\u2019</p>\n<p>When the monks told him, the Blessed One said thus:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cThe Tath\u0101gata understands these things...by his own penetration of the principles of Dhamma; and devas, too, have told him\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Former Lives of Sakka, the Lord of the Devas</h3>\n<p>In SN: Sakkasamyutta, there is a discourse of the Blessed One describing previous lives of Sakka as human being, how he had lived righteously and undertook seven vows which late brought him the status of Sakka, the Lord of the devas</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><h2>End Notes: Section 9</h2></p>\n<p>These 2 suttas give detail analysis of workings of kamma: MN: 135 (C\u016b\u1e37akammavibhanga Sutta) & MN: 136 (Mah\u0101kammavibhanga Sutta)</p>\n<p>See: MN: Introduction: Kamma & Rebirth, p. 31.</p>\n<p>In Section 5 of this compilation the Ten Powers of the Tath\u0101gata has been elaborated.</p>\n<p>For details see: MN:12 (Mah\u0101s\u012bhan\u0101da Sutta)</p>\n<p>MN: 4 (Bhayabherava Sutta).</p>\n<p>DN:14 (Mah\u0101pad\u0101na sutta)</p>\n<p>Later he became an arahant disciple of the Buddha.</p>\n<p>See: DN:Notes:717.</p>\n<p>He was formerly a student of Niganthan\u0101thaputtha; afater hering the discourse became follower of the Buddha.</p>\n<p>SN42:9 (Families sutta)</p>\n<p>* The Great Chronicles of Buddhas in Pali- Mah\u0101sa\u0144giti Tipitaka Buddhawamse  (available on line : w.w.w. suttacentral.net) * Buddhavamsa in English by Ven.
