    "Introduction": "<p><b><i>Homage to the Buddha, the Perfected One, the fully Awakened One!!!</i></b></p>\n<p><b>Introduction</b></p>\n<p>This publication is a humble endeavour to present the life of the Buddha as recorded in the Pali Tripitaka\u2014referred to here as the suttas or scriptures. Over the millennia, countless commentaries and folklore have enriched the narratives of the Buddha\u2019s life, resulting in various versions being passed down across Buddhist traditions. However, this compilation seeks to return to the earliest accounts, drawing directly from the Pali Tipitaka\u2014the very stories the Buddha himself shared about his childhood, his ministry, the people he encountered, and the journeys he undertook. From his birth in Lumbini to his final passing-away in Kusinara, this collection traces his extraordinary path, fittingly titled: \"<b>From Lumbini to Kusinara \u2013 A Life Inspired: The Wonderful Journey of Our Gotama Buddha.\"</b></p>\n<p>Around 2,600 years ago, the Buddha delivered his first sermon\u2014the Dhammacakkap -pavattana Sutta\u2014at the Deer Park in Varanasi, India, to his former ascetic companions. That moment marked the turning of the Wheel of Dhamma, setting in motion a profound spiritual awakening. For the next forty-five years, he walked the lands of northern and eastern India, known in those times as Majjhimadesa (the Central Region of Dambadiva). He wandered through villages and cities, establishing a monastic order and sharing the timeless Dhamma with people from all walks of life.</p>\n<p>Born into royal privilege, the Buddha renounced a life of luxury in pursuit of truth, seeking the path to the complete cessation of suffering. Many who heard his teachings\u2014both men and women\u2014became his disciples, some even attaining the highest realization: Nibb\u0101na.</p>\n<p>This compilation is an offering of gratitude for the priceless Dhamma\u2014the Blessed One\u2019s teachings, which continue to illuminate the path for countless beings. In this spirit, it is fitting to recall the words of Vidagama Maha Thero from the <i>Budugunaalank\u0101raya</i>, which beautifully express the reverence one feels in making even the simplest offering to the Buddha:</p>\n<p><i>The Blessed One was honoured</p>\n<p>And revered with celestial coral flowers.</p>\n<p>I have only this humble work to offer to Him, the Great Sage.</p>\n<p>My gift is but a wildflower\u2014</p>\n<p>Yet who can say it is unworthy?</i></p>\n<p>With the same humility and devotion, we present this work in homage to the Blessed One.</p>\n<p>May all beings be happy!</p>\n<p>May all beings attain Nibb\u0101na!</p>\n<p>Compiled and edited by faithful followers of the Blessed One</p>\n<p>Santi Forest Monastery</p>\n<p>Vesak, 2025.</p>\n",

A Buddha does not arise by chance but through the boundless perfections (p\u0101ram\u012b) cultivated over countless lifetimes. His birth marks the culmination of an extraordinary journey, a moment when wisdom, compassion, and virtue manifest in their highest form for the welfare of all.</p>\n<p>In this section, we reflect upon the profound significance of the birth of the Bodhisatta, who would one day become the Supreme Teacher of gods and humans, the Buddha Gotama. While the Tipi\u1e6daka does not specify the exact year of his birth, the ancient traditions of Southeast Asia widely accept that he was born in 623 B.C. on the full moon day of May (Ves\u0101kha or Vesak)\u2014a day that remains sacred to millions who honour his life and teachings. ).<span id=\"Endnote1\">[<a href=\"#endnote1\">1</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Emerging into this world in the sacred grove of Lumbini, he took his first steps upon the earth, symbolizing the arrival of one who would walk the path of truth and guide others beyond suffering.

The appearance of a Buddha in the human realm is a rare and wondrous occurrence, for he is an awakened being, a supreme teacher who illuminates the path from suffering and discontent to the ultimate freedom of Nibb\u0101na. His wisdom is a guiding light, his compassion boundless, and his teachings an enduring refuge for all who seek liberation.</p>\n<p>The scriptures speak of the immeasurable impact of such a being:</p>\n<p><i>\u201c\u2026There is one person who arises in the world for the welfare of many, for the happiness of many, out of compassion for the world, for the good, welfare, and happiness of devas and human beings\u2026 Who is that one person?

He does not merely teach the Dhamma\u2014he embodies it. With infinite patience, he reveals the path for those who wish to walk it, awakening countless beings to the truth.</p>\n<p>The birth of such a being is not just significant\u2014it is a cause for deep reverence and gratitude, for with him comes the opening of the door to the highest peace, the deathless, the unshakable liberation of Nibb\u0101na.</p>\n<p><b>Why is the Birth of the Buddha So Profoundly Significant?</b></p>\n<p>The birth of a Buddha is one of the rarest and most transformative events in the human realm. It is a moment of immense significance, for it heralds the arrival of an enlightened being\u2014one who has transcended all ignorance and suffering, who embodies boundless wisdom and compassion, and who dedicates his life to leading countless beings toward liberation.</p>\n<p>The Dhamma\u2014the sublime teachings revealed by the Buddha\u2014is an incomparable gift to the world, providing a guiding light for those seeking to transcend suffering and attain true peace. Without the appearance of a Buddha, the path to enlightenment remains hidden, lost to the world. It is only through the supreme realization of such an awakened being that the forgotten path is rediscovered, explained, and made accessible to all.</p>\n<p>In the cycle of birth and death, where beings wander endlessly through suffering, the emergence of a Buddha is an event of supreme rarity and immeasurable value. He is the one who, out of deep compassion, offers a way out of this endless cycle\u2014a way to Nibb\u0101na, the ultimate liberation. The Buddha\u2019s birth is not merely a historical occurrence; it is a cause for rejoicing among both devas and humans, for it signifies the opening of the doors to the Deathless.</p>\n<p>The scriptures express this truth with great reverence:</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026 There is one person who arises in the world</p>\n<p>for the welfare of many people,</p>\n<p>for the happiness of many people,</p>\n<p>out of compassion for the world,</p>\n<p>for the good, welfare, and happiness</p>\n<p>of devas and human beings \u2026</p>\n<p>Who is that one person?</p>\n<p>The Tath\u0101gata, the Arahant,</p>\n<p>the Perfectly Enlightened One\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>The birth of such a being is beyond measure in its significance. It is an event that reshapes the course of human history, bringing forth a timeless teaching that continues to inspire and guide beings even today. The Dhamma, proclaimed by the Buddha out of pure compassion, remains a beacon of wisdom, offering all who seek it a path toward freedom, peace, and the highest happiness.</p>\n<p>Thus, when a Buddha is born, the world is blessed beyond words. The great darkness of delusion is dispelled, and the radiant light of truth shines forth once more, illuminating the way to the highest goal\u2014Nibb\u0101na.</p>\n<p><b><u>The Buddha descending to this world</u></b></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026and on Lord Buddha, waiting in that sky,</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Came for our sakes the five sure signs of birth</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>So that the Devas knew the signs, and spoke</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201d Buddha will go again to help the World.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201d Yea!\u201d spoke He, \u201cnow I go to help the World</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This last of many times; for birth and death</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>End hence for me and those who learn my Law.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I will go down among the S\u0101kyas,</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Under the southward snows of Himalay,</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Where pious people live and a just King.\u201d <span id=\"Endnote4\">[<a href=\"#endnote4\">4</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>The Bodhisatta Descends from the Tu\u1e63ita Deva Realm</b></p>\n<p>According to Buddhist scriptures, the Buddha was born in a human realm as a Bodhisatta <span id=\"Endnote5\">[<a href=\"#endnote5\">5</a>]</span>,  having spent a period of time in the \u201cdeva\u201d realm of Tu\u1e63ita\u2019 <span id=\"Endnote6\">[<a href=\"#endnote6\">6</a>]</span>.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><img src=\"page1/image3.jpeg\" /></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>Right: Bodhisatta in Tu\u1e63ita Heaven </b>-Stone carving during the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kushan_Dynasty\"><u>Kushan Dynasty</u></a>.

The Sakyan Republic was located on the edge of the majestic Himalayas, with Kapilavattu serving as their royal capital. Though the Sakyan Republic was under the rule of the King of Kosala, it was a republican state, where power was shared among its leaders.</p>\n<p>According to both tradition and the scriptures, King Okk\u0101ka was regarded as the legendary ancestor of the Sakyans. The Amba\u1e6d\u1e6dha Sutta (DN:3) recounts a passage that highlights the origins of the Sakyan clan in these words:</p>\n<p>The Buddha said:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cThe Sakyans regard King Okk\u0101ka as their revered ancestor. Once, King Okk\u0101ka, who cherished his beloved queen, wished to transfer the kingdom to her son. To do so, he exiled his elder brothers, who took residence at the foothills of the Himalayas, beside a lotus-pond and a grand grove of teak trees\u201d</i></p>\n<p>When King Okk\u0101ka inquired about his sons' whereabouts, his ministers informed him of their location. Upon hearing this, the king declared:</p>\n<p><b><i>\u2018</i></b><i>They are strong as teak (s\u0101ka), these princes, they are true Sakyans!\u2019 And it is from this strength and resilience, like the teak tree, that the Sakyans derived their name. King Okk\u0101ka was their forefather, and from him, the noble line of the Sakyans continues.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>Thus, the Buddha\u2019s lineage is not only one of noble birth but also one of profound wisdom and strength, rooted in the strength of the teak trees and the enduring legacy of his ancestors. The Sakyan clan was marked by qualities of resilience and nobility, and it was from this noble lineage that the Sakyamuni arose, destined to awaken and share the path to liberation with all beings.</p>\n<p>The Sakyans (also called Khattiya) were rulers, and they were known for their proud and noble nature. During the time of the Buddha, society was divided into four main classes: Brahmins, who served as priests and scholars; Kshatriyas, who were warriors, kings, and rulers; Vaishyas, who were merchants and traders; and Shudras, who were labourers and servants. The Sakyans, as part of the Kshatriya class, were regarded with a sense of pride and strength. Some of the attributes of the Khattiya class are expressed in the following verses:</p>\n<p>\u201cThe Khattiya is the highest among people, for those who measure by lineage and honour...\u201d <span id=\"Endnote26\">[<a href=\"#endnote26\">26</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cThe aim of the Khattiyas is wisdom; their foundation is power. Their ambition is for territory, and their ultimate goal is sovereignty.\u201d <span id=\"Endnote27\">[<a href=\"#endnote27\">27</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Thus, the Sakyans embodied the qualities of leadership, ambition, and a deep pursuit of wisdom, standing proudly as rulers of their land and people.</p>\n<p><b>Kapilavattu the Royal City of the Sakyan</b></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Tradition holds that the city of Kapilavattu was named in honor of the great sage Kapila. According to the legend, when the exiled princes of King Okk\u0101ka ventured into the Himalayan range in search of a place to settle, they came upon the hermitage of Sage Kapila, who welcomed them with kindness and offered them refuge. Grateful for his assistance, the princes later established a city and named it Kapilavattu as a tribute to the sage who had helped them.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In the Mah\u0101pad\u0101na Sutta (DN:14), there is a passage where the devas refer to Kapilavattu as the birthplace of the Buddha:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\u201c\u2026In this fortunate aeon, the Lord Buddha has arisen in the world\u2026 His father is King Suddhodana, his mother was Queen Maya, and his royal capital is Kapilavattu\u2026\u201d</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Further, in the Mah\u0101parinibb\u0101na Sutta (DN:16), when the Buddha passed away, the Sakyans of Kapilavattu sent a request for his relics, as they considered themselves the rightful heirs of the Buddha\u2019s legacy:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\u201c\u2026The Sakyas of Kapilavattu heard of the Buddha\u2019s passing, and they sent a message saying: \u2018The Lord was the chief of our clan. We are worthy to receive a share of his remains, and we will construct a great stupa in his honor\u2026\u2019 The Sakyans of Kapilavattu built a stupa at Kapilavattu.\u201d</i></p>\n<p><b>Location of Kapilavattu</b></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The map below shows the modern locations of Kapilavattu 1) site is in present day Nepal in Tilaurakot and the 2) site in Piprahawa of India.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><img src=\"page1/image16.png\" /></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>During the Buddha's lifetime, Kapilavattu was a prominent and well-known city located in the northern region of Jambudv\u012bpa, the ancient name for the Indian subcontinent. As the capital of the Sakyan clan, it was a bustling, prosperous city with a rich cultural and political significance. Mah\u0101n\u0101ma, a prominent member of the Sakyan clan, described the city\u2019s vibrant nature in this way:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\u201cThis Kapilavattu is rich and prosperous, populous and crowded, with its thoroughfares congested. In the evening, when I return to Kapilavattu after visiting the Blessed One or the esteemed bhikkhus, I often encounter stray elephants, horses, chariots, carts, and even people wandering about in excitement\u2026\u201d</i><span id=\"Endnote28\">[<a href=\"#endnote28\">28</a>]</span><i> </i></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This passage paints a vivid picture of the city\u2019s lively, bustling atmosphere, filled with activity and spiritual significance.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>According to tradition and scriptures, Kapilavattu eventually met its destruction at the hands of King Vidudabha, the son of the late King Pasenadi Kosala. This tragic event marked the end of an era for the city, but Kapilavattu's importance as the birthplace of the Buddha and the home of the Sakyan clan continues to resonate throughout Buddhist history. <span id=\"Endnote29\">[<a href=\"#endnote29\">29</a>]</span> .</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The ruins of Kapilavattu, the Buddha\u2019s birthplace, were discovered relatively recently during the period of British India (1858-1947).

The site in Nepal, known as Tilaurakot, is located in the present-day Kapilavattu District, while the site in India, known as Piprahwa, is a village near Siddharthnagar in the state of Uttar Pradesh.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The debate over the exact location of Kapilavattu remains unresolved.

The Buddha has shown that his teachings are <i>\u2018ehipassika</i>\u2019\u2014 come and see\u2014so the disciples are free to follow or disrobe! Many of the early disciples of the Buddha\u2019s order were students of other religious leaders, or people who followed other philosophies or views. In most cases, they have seen the Blessed One, heard the Dhamma, become inspired by his wisdom and compassion and thus established faith in him. Similarly, if someone is not interested in living the monastic life or does not have the strength to continue, there is no obstacle to disrobe and return to lay life. However, for the welfare of other students, the Buddha has advised that proper steps should be taken to remove those who do not behave in accordance with Vinaya rules.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><img src=\"page11_1/image1.jpeg\" /></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>The Buddha Teaching monks</b>: Picture courtesy Gettyimages</p>\n<h2>\u25b2<b>To Follow the Middle Way\u2014The Noble Eightfold Path</b></h2>\n<p>The Buddha often expressed to the Sangha his own experience in seeking the truth\u2014an escape from worldly suffering.  As a prince from royal family, he had all the pleasures of the world (see: section 1 &amp; 2) so he understood how sensuality bonds a person to the worldly life. Then as an ascetic, he practiced extreme austere practices thinking it would lead him to</p>\n<p>Enlightenment. Finally, through his wisdom and effort he achieved freedom from suffering (see Sections 3 &amp; 4). Hence, the Blessed One advised his disciples: not to be indulge in sensual pleasures, nor follow extreme practices that torment the body which will lead to a disturb mind. The following extracts from scriptures, show us the importance of the middle path.</p>\n<p><i>\u201c\u2026bhikkhus, \u2026I strove indefatigably\u2026 \u2018willingly, let only my skin, sinews, and bones remain, and let the flesh and blood dry up in my body, but I will not relax my energy so long as I have not attained what can be attained by manly strength, energy, and exertion.\u2019 It was by heedfulness that I achieved enlightenment, bhikkhus; it was by heedfulness that I achieved the unsurpassed security from bondage\u2026\u201d</i> <span id=\"Endnote1\">[<a href=\"#endnote1\">1</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Then he encouraged the Middle way:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cBhikkhus, these two extremes should not be followed by one who has gone forth into homelessness.

One is the development of serenity (samatha), which aims at concentration (sam\u0101dhi); the other is the development of insight (vipassan\u0101), which aims at understanding or wisdom (pa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101). In the Buddha\u2019s system of mental training the role of serenity is subordinated to that of insight because the latter is the crucial instrument needed to uproot the ignorance at the bottom of sa\u1e41s\u0101ric bondage. The attainments possible through serenity meditation were known to Indian contemplatives long before the advent of the Buddha. The Buddha himself mastered the two highest stages under his early teachers but found that, on their own, they only led to higher planes of rebirth, not to genuine enlightenment (MN 26.15\u201316). However, because the unification of mind induced by the practice of concentration contributes to clear understanding, the Buddha incorporated the techniques of serenity meditation and the resulting levels of absorption into his own system, treating them as a foundation and preparation for insight and as a \u201cpleasant abiding here and now\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p><b>Quote from Bhikkhu Bodhi</b> (MN: Introduction)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>\u2666 Commending Meditation</b></p>\n<p>In his teaching the Blessed One often pointed out that Samadhi and wisdom go hand in hand. Therefore, he emphasised meditation and urged the Sangha to meditate and achieve stillness of the mind. He often pointed out that the final liberation cannot be perceived by those who are immersed in lust, hate and delusion. Rather, through deep meditation all desires could be abandoned and freedom achieved.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><img src=\"page11_1/image3.jpeg\" /></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>Picture courtesy</b>: https://declutterthemind.com/</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>\u2666 Meditation is Important for Spiritual Enhancement</b></p>\n<p>In the following sutta we can further see how the Blessed One pointed out the importance of meditation\u2014Samadhi\u2014stillness of mind for spiritual growth.</p>\n<p><i>\u201c\u2026bhikkhus, the safe and good path to be travelled joyfully has been reopened by me, the wrong path has been closed off, the decoy removed, the dummy destroyed\u2026what should be done for his disciples out of compassion by a teacher who seeks their welfare and has compassion for them, that I have done for you, bhikkhus.

Now, we explore his early years, from childhood to the transformative moment at the age of twenty-nine, when he left his royal life behind to embark on the path of an ascetic in search of liberation.</p>\n<p><b>The Family of Prince Siddhartha</b></p>\n<p>Prince Siddhartha\u2019s name, Siddhartha, means \u201c<b>he who achieves his goal,</b>\u201d <b> </b><span id=\"Endnote1\">[<a href=\"#endnote1\">1</a>]</span> and indeed, his life would unfold to achieve the supreme goal of enlightenment, bringing profound peace and wisdom to countless beings. Born in the city of Kapilavattu, Prince Siddhartha belonged to the Sakya Clan, a noble family of rulers. His father, King Suddhodana, and his mother, Queen Mahamaya, were revered for their wisdom and compassion. <span id=\"Endnote2\">[<a href=\"#endnote2\">2</a>]</span> However, the life of this noble prince was marked by profound sorrow, as his mother, Queen Mahamaya, passed away just seven days after his birth. <span id=\"Endnote3\">[<a href=\"#endnote3\">3</a>]</span></p>\n<p>In a gesture of love and compassion, Queen Prajapati, Queen Mahamaya\u2019s sister and King Suddhodana\u2019s second consort, stepped forward as the prince\u2019s foster mother. Queen Prajapati would later become a prominent figure in the Buddha\u2019s teachings, being the first to be ordained as a Bhikkhuni in the community of nuns, embodying the noble qualities of devotion and compassion.</p>\n<p>Prince Siddhartha also had a half-brother, Prince Nanda, and a half-sister, Princess Nand\u0101, children of King Suddhodana and Queen Prajapati, who were also part of the royal family that would witness the unfolding of his extraordinary destiny.</p>\n<p>The scriptures beautifully recount the significance of Prince Siddhartha\u2019s family. In the Mah\u0101pad\u0101na Sutta (DN:14), the Devas express the auspiciousness of the Buddha\u2019s birth and his noble lineage:</p>\n<p><i>\u201c\u2026In this fortunate aeon now, the Lord Buddha has arisen in the world\u2026 His father is King Suddhodana, his mother was Queen Maya, and his royal capital is Kapilavattu\u2026\u201d</i></p>\n<p>In the Udana, Venerable \u0100nanda Thera reflects on the profound nature of the Buddha\u2019s mother\u2019s passing: <span id=\"Endnote4\">[<a href=\"#endnote4\">4</a>]</span></p>\n<p><i>\u201c\u2026It\u2019s incredible, sir, it\u2019s amazing! How short-lived was the Blessed One\u2019s mother! For seven days after the Blessed One was born, his mother passed away and was reborn in the host of joyful gods (Tusita heaven)\u201d</i></p>\n<p>The Buddha, in his compassionate wisdom, explains:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cThat\u2019s so true, \u0100nanda! For the mothers of being\u2019s intent on awakening are short-lived. Seven days after the being\u2019s intent on awakening are born, their mothers pass away and are reborn in the host of joyful gods\u2026\u201d</i></p>\n<p>This passage illuminates the deep connection between the Buddha\u2019s life and the unfolding of his path to enlightenment, revealing the divine significance of his birth and the transcendent nature of his family. The early loss of his mother, though heartbreaking, set the stage for Siddhartha\u2019s eventual awakening and the subsequent teachings that would uplift all beings.</p>\n<p>The noble birth of Prince Siddhartha in the Sakyan family was not just a royal event; it was the beginning of a journey that would transcend worldly existence, ultimately bringing forth the wisdom that would guide countless beings to liberation. The compassion and the divine purpose behind his birth and his family\u2019s role in his life serve as a profound reminder of the interconnectedness of all beings and the deep compassion that the Buddha embodied, not only for his family but for the entire world.</p>\n<p><b>Ven.

At just seven years old, Prince Siddhartha was found meditating under a Rose Apple tree. In this serene moment, it is said that he entered the first Jhana, a deep state of meditation. This early experience of profound samadhi  and mindfulness would later lay the foundation for his spiritual journey to enlightenment.</p>\n<p>After attaining Buddhahood, the Blessed One recalled this moment from his childhood, describing it in the following way:</p>\n<p><i>\u201c\u2026I recall that when my father, the Sakyan, was occupied, I sat in the cool shade of a rose-apple tree, completely secluded from sensual pleasures and free from unwholesome states.

Yet, his true fortune lay not in royal privilege, but in the rare opportunity to walk the noble path under the direct guidance of the Buddha himself.</p>\n<p>According to tradition, when Prince Siddhartha renounced the world, R\u0101hula was still an infant. He was raised in the comforts of the palace by his loving mother and grandparents, unaware that his destiny would soon lead him far beyond the luxuries of royal life.</p>\n<p>The <i>Vinaya Pitaka</i> describes the remarkable event of his ordination at the tender age of seven: <span id=\"Endnote22\">[<a href=\"#endnote22\">22</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>After spending time in R\u0101jagaha, the Buddha set out on a journey back to Kapilavattu. Upon his arrival, he stayed at the Banyan Tree Monastery. The next morning, he robed up and went to the palace of King Suddhodana, where a seat had been prepared for him.</p>\n<p>Seeing the Buddha, Queen Yasodhar\u0101 gently encouraged her young son:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cThis is your father, R\u0101hula. Go and ask for your inheritance.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>With innocent reverence, Prince R\u0101hula approached the Buddha, stood before him, and softly said:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cAscetic, your shadow is pleasant.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>As the Buddha rose to leave, the child followed him, joyfully calling out:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cGive me my inheritance!

Venerable S\u0101riputta was entrusted with his training, guiding him with wisdom and compassion.</p>\n<p><b>King Suddhodana\u2019s Grief</b></p>\n<p>However, the news of R\u0101hula\u2019s ordination pierced King Suddhodana\u2019s heart with sorrow. Already having endured the departure of both Siddhartha and Nanda, the loss of his beloved grandson was too much to bear. He went to the Buddha and, with a heavy heart, expressed his pain:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cWhen the Buddha went forth, it was painful for me. When Nanda went forth, it was painful again.

Word spread quickly, and when King Suddhodana heard that his son\u2014the prince who once lived in luxury\u2014was now seeking alms like a wandering mendicant, his heart was filled with dismay. Overcome with concern and the pride of a Sakyan ruler, the king hurried to meet the Blessed One.

His Great Renunciation stands as one of the most significant events in Buddhist history, a momentous milestone for the entire Buddhist world.</p>\n<p>The Buddha\u2019s noble departure set an unparalleled example of renouncing lay life for the path of liberation, inspiring generations of monks and nuns to follow in his footsteps.

The suttas provide glimpses into what stirred his heart and led him to abandon his royal life in pursuit of the highest truth.</p>\n<p><b>Witnessing the Suffering of Life\u2014Old Age, Sickness, and Death</b></p>\n<p>The Buddha later recounted:<span id=\"Endnote5\">[<a href=\"#endnote5\">5</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cBhikkhus, I was delicately nurtured\u2014most delicately nurtured, extremely delicately nurtured...

He saw with great clarity that all beings\u2014no matter their status, wealth, or power\u2014are bound by aging, illness, and death. The fleeting pleasures of the world could not offer lasting peace or freedom. With this realization, he set forth in search of a way beyond suffering, seeking the ultimate truth (<i>ki\u1e43kusal\u0101nues\u012b?</i>).</p>\n<p><b>The Buddha\u2019s Own Words on Renunciation</b></p>\n<p><i>\u201cWhile I was dwelling thus,</p>\n<p>Having known the state beyond all grasping,</p>\n<p>I overcame every intoxication\u2014</p>\n<p>Intoxication with health,</p>\n<p>Intoxication with youth,</p>\n<p>Intoxication with life\u2014</p>\n<p>Having seen security in renunciation.</i></p>\n<p><i>Zeal then arose in me, as I clearly saw Nibb\u0101na.</p>\n<p>Now I am incapable of indulging in sensual pleasures.</p>\n<p>Relying on the spiritual life, never will I turn back.\u201d</i><span id=\"Endnote6\">[<a href=\"#endnote6\">6</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Prince Siddhartha\u2019s renunciation was not a rejection of life, but an act of supreme compassion\u2014for himself and for all beings trapped in <i>sa\u1e43s\u0101ra</i>. His journey into homelessness was a path of courage, wisdom, and boundless resolve, leading to the great awakening that would illuminate the world.</p>\n<p>According to legend, Prince Siddhartha witnessed four significant omens\u2014an old man, a sick man, a dead body, and a recluse. Reflecting deeply upon them, he became determined to renounce his princely life in search of a higher truth <span id=\"Endnote7\">[<a href=\"#endnote7\">7</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Apart from a passage in the <i>Khuddaka Nik\u0101ya: Buddhava\u1e43sa</i> (quoted below), no other direct reference to these four events leading to Prince Siddhartha\u2019s renunciation can be found in the scriptures. However, traditional Buddhist narratives recount that he first encountered an old person, a sick person, and a dead body in a funeral procession. These sights deeply moved him, making him realize the impermanence of life\u2014that all beings inevitably age, fall ill, and die.</p>\n<p>The final omen, that of a serene ascetic, struck him profoundly. The sight of someone who had renounced worldly pleasures in pursuit of inner peace and liberation inspired him to abandon his own luxurious life and seek the path beyond suffering.</p>\n<p><i>\"I lived as a householder for thirty-one years...

In traditional accounts, it is often portrayed as a sudden departure\u2014leaving his loved ones behind without consultation or conversation. However, the suttas provide a deeper perspective, revealing the immense wisdom and compassion that guided his decision.</p>\n<p>In the following sutta, the Buddha himself describes the thoughts that led him to renounce the world:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cWhy, being myself subject to birth, do I seek what is also subject to birth? Why, being myself subject to aging, sickness, death, sorrow, and defilement, do I seek what is also subject to aging, sickness, death, sorrow, and defilement?</i></p>\n<p><i>Suppose that, being myself subject to birth, having understood the danger in what is subject to birth, I seek the unborn, the supreme security from bondage... </i><b><i>Later, while still young\u2014a black-haired young man, endowed with the blessing of youth, in the prime of life\u2014though my mother and father wished otherwise and wept with tearful faces,</i></b><i> I shaved off my hair and beard, donned the yellow robe, and went forth from the home life into homelessness.\u201d</i> <span id=\"Endnote9\">[<a href=\"#endnote9\">9</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Though young and surrounded by royal luxuries, Prince Siddhartha saw the true nature of existence\u2014impermanence, suffering, and the endless cycle of birth and death. He realized that worldly pleasures were fleeting and incapable of providing lasting peace. This profound understanding shaped his path toward renunciation.</p>\n<p><b>A Deeper Understanding of His Departure</b></p>\n<p>It is possible that Prince Siddhartha discussed these truths with his beloved wife, Princess Yasodhar\u0101. In the <i>J\u0101taka Stories</i>\u2014which recount the Buddha\u2019s past lives\u2014they had been husband and wife across many lifetimes. In those past lives, whenever the Bodhisatta renounced the world, his wife supported and encouraged him. It is reasonable to believe that in his final life as Prince Siddhartha, she too understood the depth of his aspirations and the nobility of his quest.</p>\n<p>Traditional narratives often leave gaps in the story of his renunciation. Yet, when the Blessed One later returned to Kapilavattu, Princess Yasodhar\u0101 displayed remarkable wisdom and devotion. She pointed out the Buddha to their son, Prince R\u0101hula, and encouraged him to approach his father, saying:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cThat is your father, dear R\u0101hula. Go to him and ask for your inheritance.\u201d</i> <span id=\"Endnote10\">[<a href=\"#endnote10\">10</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>What inheritance could the Buddha offer his son? A <i>Samm\u0101sambuddha</i> possesses no material wealth, no kingdom, no treasures. The only gift he could bestow\u2014the greatest gift in the world\u2014was the path to liberation, the way to be free from <i>sa\u1e43s\u0101ric</i> suffering.</p>\n<p>Princess Yasodhar\u0101, a wise and loving mother, understood this truth. She did not cling to worldly attachments but instead guided her son toward the highest refuge.</p>\n<p><b>The Compassion Behind His Departure</b></p>\n<p>Would a being of such boundless wisdom and compassion leave without any parting words? It is unlikely. A prince destined to become the Buddha, who deeply loved his family, would not have abandoned them thoughtlessly.</p>\n<p>His renunciation was not an act of disregard but of profound love\u2014love that extended beyond a single lifetime, beyond personal relationships, toward the liberation of all beings. He set forth on this noble journey, not to turn away from his loved ones, but to find a way to end suffering for them and for the entire world.</p>\n<p>Thus, the Great Renunciation was not an escape, nor was it a selfish act\u2014it was the greatest sacrifice ever made for the welfare of all beings.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><img src=\"page3/image3.jpeg\" /></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>Above</b>: <b>Prince Siddhartha leaves the Palace riding his horse amidst gathering of his family and friends:</b> Picture courtesy: Wikipedia: <b>Source:</b> Pakistan, Gandhara, schist, 2nd-3rd century,</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>San Diego Museum of Art</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><img src=\"page3/image4.jpeg\" /></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>Prince Siddhartha shaves his hair and becomes a\u00a0</b><b>\u015brama\u1e47a</b><b>.\u00a0</b><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borobudur\"><b>Borobudur</b></a><b>, 8th century</b></p>\n<p><b>Author: </b><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Gunkarta\"><b>Gunawan Kartapranata</b></a><b> Courtesy: </b><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Buddha#/media/File:Siddharta_Gautama_Borobudur.jpg\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Buddha#/media/File:Siddharta_Gautama_Borobudur.jpg</a></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><img src=\"page3/image5.jpeg\" /></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>Ascetic Siddhartha reflecting on his new freedom beside the river Anoma</b></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Image: Specially created by Chat: GPT</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>The Wanderings of Ascetic Siddhartha</b></p>\n<p>After renouncing lay life, Ascetic Siddhartha embarked on a profound journey in search of the <i>Truth</i>.

He pointed out to us that pleasure of deep samadhi- Jhanas bring only wholesome and peace. This is important for mediator, as it shows that the pleasures-bliss come out from deep mediation should not be discard as it is part and partial of the practice.

In his own words:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\u201cBhikkhus, before my enlightenment, while I was still a Bodhisatta, not yet fully awakened, five great dreams appeared to me.

This signified his coming enlightenment\u2014an awakening that would shake the entire world and bring boundless benefit to all beings.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2)\t<b>The Grass Touching the Sky</b></p>\n<p>He saw a sacred grass (<i>tiriy\u0101</i>) growing from his navel, stretching up and touching the sky. This represented his realization of the Noble Eightfold Path and his role in proclaiming it to devas and humans alike.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>3)\t<b>White Worms with Black Heads</b></p>\n<p>He dreamt of white worms with black heads crawling from his feet up to his knees, covering them completely. This symbolized the vast number of lay disciples who would embrace his teachings and follow his path.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>4)\t<b>The Four Birds Turning White</b></p>\n<p>Four birds of different colours\u2014coming from the four directions\u2014fell at his feet and turned completely white. This signified that people from all social classes\u2014khattiyas (nobles), brahmins (priests), vessas (merchants), and suddas (labourers)\u2014would renounce the household life, enter the monastic path, and become his disciples.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>5)\t<b>Climbing a Mountain of Dung</b></p>\n<p>He saw himself ascending a massive mountain of dung, yet remaining completely unsoiled.

Right Effort (<i>samm\u0101v\u0101yama</i>), a vital aspect of the Noble Eightfold Path, is the foundation of spiritual progress. It is the dedicated resolve to:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\tAbandon unwholesome qualities that have already arisen,</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\tPrevent unwholesome qualities from arising,</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\tCultivate wholesome qualities that have not yet arisen, and</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\tStrengthen and develop wholesome qualities that already exist.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Right Effort is not merely a discipline\u2014it is a compassionate and guiding force, a helping hand that uplifts us toward the ultimate goal of liberation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>The Offering of Suj\u0101t\u0101\u2014A Moment of Significance</b></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Tradition tells us that on the morning of his enlightenment, the Bodhisatta Siddhartha received a nourishing meal of milk rice from Suj\u0101t\u0101, the daughter of a householder in the village of Senani near Uruvel\u0101. <span id=\"Endnote11\">[<a href=\"#endnote11\">11</a>]</span> While the scriptures do not explicitly mention this event, the <i>Anguttara Nik\u0101ya</i> (AN 1:258) offers a striking reference to her:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b><i>\u201c\u2026the foremost of my female lay followers in being the first to go for refuge is Suj\u0101t\u0101, daughter of Sen\u0101n\u012b.\u201d</i></b></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This passage suggests that she played an unparalleled role in the Buddha\u2019s journey, offering a gift of sustenance that would empower him to take his final steps toward enlightenment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>The Sacred Act of Offering</b></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The <i>Mah\u0101parinibb\u0101na Sutta</i> (DN:16) records the Blessed One\u2019s words about two uniquely meritorious acts of giving:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b><i>\u201c\u2026these two alms-giving\u2019s are of very great fruit, of very great result, more fruitful and advantageous than any other.

In <i>Anguttara Nik\u0101ya</i> (AN 1: XIV), all other lay disciples described as foremost in different qualities are those who sought refuge in the Buddha after his enlightenment. Could Suj\u0101t\u0101\u2019s refuge have been an act of devotion preceding all others?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In contrast, the <i>Vinaya Pi\u1e6daka</i> <span id=\"Endnote13\">[<a href=\"#endnote13\">13</a>]</span> tells us that the first male lay disciples were the merchants Tapussa and Bhallika, who encountered the Buddha after his awakening. The Buddha acknowledged them as the first to take refuge, saying:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\u201cBhikkhus, the foremost of my male lay followers in being the first to go for refuge are the merchants Tapussa and Bhallika.\u201d</i> (AN 1:248)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Having received his alms, they bowed before the Blessed One and declared:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\u201cSir, we go for refuge to the Buddha and the Teaching. Please accept us as lay followers who have gone for refuge for life.\u201d</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>They thus became the first lay followers by way of the Double Refuge (<i>Buddha</i> and <i>Dhamma</i>).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This raises a compelling question: Was Suj\u0101t\u0101\u2019s offering a reverence to the ascetic Siddhartha before his enlightenment? Or was it a tribute to the newly awakened Buddha, the first act of homage by a laywoman? While the answer remains uncertain, her role in the sacred unfolding of the Buddha\u2019s enlightenment remains undeniably profound.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>Supreme Enlightenment \u2013 Samm\u0101sambodhi</b></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>With unwavering determination and an unshakable resolve for liberation, the Bodhisatta strengthened his courage and deepened his effort.

According to the Mah\u0101pad\u0101na Sutta (DN:14), during the past ninety-one aeons, only seven Buddhas have arisen in the world. Buddhas appear at vast intervals of time, and during the long, immeasurable ages between their appearances, the world remains without a Buddha (abuddhassa).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In the absence of a Buddha, beings remain shrouded in the darkness of ignorance, unable to find the way to liberation.

Only a Samm\u0101sambuddha has both the wisdom and the boundless compassion to proclaim the path to all beings, ensuring that the light of the Dhamma continues to shine, guiding generations long after his passing.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>The Supreme Healer of the World</b></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A Samm\u0101sambuddha is like the supreme physician, tending to the ailments of the world.

It continues to roll until the dispensation of the Buddha gradually fades from the earth.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>A Rare and Precious Opportunity</b></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This truth should encourage and uplift the followers of the Blessed One.

He reflected thus:</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>I have discovered this profound truth, so hard to see, so hard to comprehend.

In the history of the Buddha\u2019s dispensation, we can see that the foundation of the Fourfold Sangha was laid during this period.</p>\n<p>At that time, two brothers, Tapussa and Bhallika, were traveling from Ukkal\u0101 to Uruvel\u0101, near the place of the Buddha\u2019s enlightenment. Following the advice of a deva, they offered food to the Buddha. After making the offering, they paid homage to him and requested to be accepted as his lay followers. <span id=\"Endnote62\">[<a href=\"#endnote62\">62</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In establishing the dispensation, the Blessed One, recognizing the importance of monastic disciples (both monks and nuns), also encouraged lay followers to become his disciples. This was not only for their own spiritual development but also to ensure the monastic community received the necessary support in the form of the four requisites essential for their survival.</p>\n<p>From the time of the Blessed One until the present day, the unwavering support of lay devotees has enabled the Buddha\u2019s dispensation to continue flourishing and illuminating the world.

This event further illustrates one of the noble qualities of the Buddha: <b>\"Teacher of humans and devas.\"</b></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\t\tIt is mentioned that Buddhas do not receive food with their hands. When the Blessed One was contemplating how to accept the meal offered by Tapussa and Bhallika, the Four Great Kings presented him with four crystal bowls.

Sometimes the texts use the word \u201cM\u0101ra\u201d in a metaphorical sense, as representing the inward psychological causes of bondage such as craving and lust and the external things to which we become bound, particularly the five aggregates themselves. But it is evident that the thought world of the suttas does not conceive M\u0101ra only as a personification of humankind\u2019s moral frailty, but sees him as a real evil deity out to frustrate the efforts of those intent on winning the ultimate goal. The proof of this lies in his pursuit of the Buddha and the arahants after their enlightenment, which would not be credible if he were conceived of merely as a psychological projection. <b>See</b>: SN: Introduction to Sgathavagga, 4.

Now, we turn our attention to the profound moment when the Blessed One established the Fourfold Assembly\u2014bhikkhus (monks), bhikkhunis (nuns), up\u0101sakas (laymen), and up\u0101sik\u0101s (laywomen)\u2014the foundation upon which the Dhamma would take root and flourish for the welfare of countless beings.</p>\n<p><b>Preparing to Teach the Dhamma</b></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Having awakened to the ultimate truth, the Buddha, the Compassionate One, did not keep his realization to himself. Out of boundless loving-kindness, he resolved to gather disciples who would transcend worldly bondage and become bearers of the Dhamma, guiding others beyond the clutches of M\u0101ra.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Yet, M\u0101ra, the tempter, knowing that the Buddha\u2019s teachings would liberate beings from his grasp, sought to dissuade him from sharing the Dhamma. The scriptures recount this moment:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>M\u0101ra spoke: <span id=\"Endnote1\">[<a href=\"#endnote1\">1</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\u201cIf you have discovered the path, the secure way leading to the Deathless, then walk it alone.

The primary purpose of forming this assembly was to preserve the Buddha\u2019s teachings in their true essence, ensuring that both the Dhamma and Vinaya remained intact.

Their unwavering faith and commitment ensured the flourishing of the Buddha\u2019s teachings in both monastic and lay communities.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The first to take refuge as lay followers were Tapussa and Bhallika, two merchant brothers traveling from Ukkal\u0101 to Uruvel\u0101.

He instructed his student to check all the noble qualities and also the so-called thirty-two physical marks attributed to the Buddha. Agreeing to fulfill his teachers wish, Uttara</p>\n<p>followed the Blessed One for seven months like a shadow, never leaving him.

He approached the Buddha, exchanged greetings and sat down nearby and looked for the thirty-two marks of a Great Man on the Blessed One\u2019s body, seeing all of them except two. The Blessed One, knowing that doubt occurred in the mind of Sela, performed a feat of supernormal power so the brahmin Sela saw the missing two marks.

He taught that a mind</p>\n<p>purified by wisdom leads to true liberation. Sitting in that assembly was the Brahmin Sundarika Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja, who believed in ritual purification through sacred river bathing. When he heard the Buddha speak of \u2018inner bathing,\u2019 he became intrigued and asked:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cMaster Gotama, do you go to the B\u0101huk\u0101 River to bathe?\u201d</i> <span id=\"Endnote5\">[<a href=\"#endnote5\">5</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Buddha inquired why he considered bathing in the river necessary, and Sundarika Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja replied:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cMaster Gotama, many believe that the B\u0101huk\u0101 River grants liberation, bestows merit, and washes away evil deeds.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>The Blessed One then spoke these timeless verses:</p>\n<p>\u201c<i>B\u0101huk\u0101 and Adhikakk\u0101, Gay\u0101\u2026</p>\n<p>and the stream Bahumat\u012b,</p>\n<p>A fool may there forever bathe,</p>\n<p>Yet will not purify dark deeds.</i></p>\n<p><i>One pure in heart has evermore,</p>\n<p>\u2026one fair in act, one pure in heart,</p>\n<p>Brings his virtue to perfection.</i></p>\n<p><i>It is here, Brahmin, that you should bathe,</p>\n<p>To make yourself a refuge for all beings.</i></p>\n<p><i>With faith and free from avarice,</p>\n<p>What need for you to go to Gay\u0101?</p>\n<p>For any well will be your Gay\u0101.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>Hearing these sublime words, Sundarika Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja was overcome with reverence. He realized that true purification comes not from external rituals, but from purifying the heart through wisdom and virtue. With great joy, he exclaimed:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cMagnificent, Master Gotama! You have made the Dhamma clear, as one who turns upright what was overturned, reveals what was hidden, shows the way to the lost, or holds a lamp in the dark for those with sight to see.

When that blind man accepted the soiled rag, believing it to be pure, did he do so out of knowledge and vision, or out of faith in another?\u201d</p>\n<p>M\u0101gandiya answered:</p>\n<p>\u201cVenerable sir, he would have done so blindly, out of faith in another.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Buddha then declared:</p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026So too, M\u0101gandiya, the wanderers of other sects are blind and visionless.

When that fuel was used up, if it did not get any more fuel, being without fuel, it is reckoned as extinguished.\u201d</p>\n<p>Through the simile of the extinguished fire, the Blessed One demonstrated the pointlessness of speculative views regarding the destiny of an enlightened being.

The king pleaded for his life and was granted release on one condition\u2014he had to provide the yakkha with a human sacrifice each day.</p>\n<p>At first, the king sent criminals from the royal prison. But when there were no more prisoners left, he decreed that each family in the kingdom must offer a child.

Then the yakkha ordered, \u201cCome in, ascetic!\u201d and the Blessed One re-entered.</p>\n<p>This exchange happened three times. The Buddha complied each time, knowing that yielding would be the most effective way to soften the yakkha\u2019s mind. However, when \u0100\u1e37avaka intended to keep sending him in and out all night, the Master firmly refused, saying, \u201cI will not go out, friend. Do whatever you must.\u201d <span id=\"Endnote20\">[<a href=\"#endnote20\">20</a>]</span></p>\n<p>Enraged, the yakkha threatened him:</p>\n<p>\u201c I will question you, ascetic.

Ask whatever you wish.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u0100\u1e37avaka then questioned the Buddha about truthfulness, wisdom, self-control, generosity, duty, patience, and more.

Instead, understanding her suffering, he offered a task:</p>\n<p>\"Bring me a few mustard seeds from any household,\" he said, \"but the seeds must come from a home that has never known death.\"</p>\n<p>Filled with hope, Kis\u0101 Gotam\u012b set off at once, going door to door in search of the mustard seeds.</p>\n<p>At the first house, the family readily agreed to give her some. Just before taking them, she asked, \"Has anyone ever died in this house?\"</p>\n<p>The family replied, \"Yes, our father passed away recently.\"</p>\n<p>Disheartened, but still determined, she moved to the next house. Again, they were willing to give her mustard seeds, but when she asked the same question, she received the same response\u2014someone in their family had died.</p>\n<p>House after house, she searched, but everywhere, death had left its mark.</p>\n<p>As she continued her journey, a realization began to dawn upon her. No house was free from death. No family was untouched by loss. Finally, she understood the deeper meaning behind the Buddha\u2019s request. It had never been about the mustard seeds. The Blessed One had gently guided her to see the universal truth\u2014all who are born must one day pass away.</p>\n<p>Her sorrow transformed into wisdom. Carrying her child\u2019s body to the cremation ground, she bid him farewell and let go of her grief. Then, with a heart opened to the truth, she returned to the Buddha.</p>\n<p>The Blessed One taught her the Dhamma, revealing the nature of existence and the path to liberation. Kis\u0101 Gotam\u012b, deeply moved, renounced her lay life and became a bhikkhun\u012b. Diligently practicing according to the Dhamma, she attained arahantship\u2014the state of complete liberation.</p>\n<p>Her realization was so profound that when M\u0101ra, the Evil One, attempted to shake her resolve, she remained unshaken. In the <i>Sa\u1e43yutta Nik\u0101ya (SN: Bhikkhun\u012b Sa\u1e43yutta)</i>, we find the verses of Venerable Kis\u0101 Gotam\u012b, fearlessly confronting M\u0101ra himself:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>M\u0101ra said:</p>\n<p>\"Why now, when your son is dead,</p>\n<p>Do you sit alone with tearful face?</p>\n<p>Having entered the woods all alone,</p>\n<p>Are you searching for a man?\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The bhikkhun\u012b replied:</p>\n<p>\"I have moved beyond the death of sons;</p>\n<p>With that, the search for men has ended.</p>\n<p>I do not sorrow, I do not weep,</p>\n<p>Nor do I fear you, friend!\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Realizing that Bhikkhun\u012b Kis\u0101 Gotam\u012b had seen through his deception, M\u0101ra, disappointed and defeated, vanished on the spot. Thus, through wisdom and insight, Kis\u0101 Gotam\u012b transcended grief and attained the highest peace\u2014Nibb\u0101na.<span id=\"Endnote30\">[<a href=\"#endnote30\">30</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>Taming Angulim\u0101la -The Serial Killer Who Became an Arahant </b><span id=\"Endnote31\">[<a href=\"#endnote31\">31</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>During his time in Jeta\u2019s Grove, S\u0101vatth\u012b, the Blessed One became aware of a notorious bandit named Angulim\u0101la, who terrorized the forests of the Kosala region. Angulim\u0101la had been deceived by a corrupt teacher into believing that he needed to collect a thousand human fingers as an offering. Merciless in his pursuit, he had already claimed 999 victims\u2014only one more was needed to complete his gruesome garland.</p>\n<p>With his divine eye, the Buddha saw that Angulim\u0101la\u2019s own mother was unknowingly walking toward the forest, about to become his final victim. But the Blessed One also perceived something even more profound\u2014Angulim\u0101la had the potential to attain arahantship. Moved by boundless compassion, the Buddha set out to intercept him, determined to prevent a matricide, one of the five most heinous crimes that lead to immediate rebirth in hell.</p>\n<p>As the Buddha walked calmly along the forest path, Angulim\u0101la spotted him and rushed forward with his sword drawn, ready to claim his final finger. But something astonishing happened\u2014the Blessed One, walking at his normal pace, remained impossibly out of reach. No matter how fast Angulim\u0101la ran, he could not close the distance. Bewildered, he thought:</p>\n<p>\u201cHow incredible! I have chased down swift elephants, galloping horses, and even fleeing deer, yet though I run with all my strength, I cannot catch this recluse, who simply walks.\u201d</p>\n<p>Realizing the futility of his pursuit, he called out in frustration:</p>\n<p>\"Stop, recluse! Stop, recluse!\"</p>\n<p>The Buddha turned and replied with words that would change Angulim\u0101la\u2019s life forever:</p>\n<p>\"I have stopped, Angulim\u0101la. You stop too.\"</p>\n<p>Confused, Angulim\u0101la asked,</p>\n<p>\"But you are still walking, recluse. How can you say you have stopped? And how can you claim that I have not?\"</p>\n<p>With serene wisdom, the Buddha answered:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"Angulim\u0101la, I have stopped forever.</p>\n<p>I abstain from harming any living being.</p>\n<p>But you have not stopped\u2014you continue to take life.</p>\n<p>That is why I have stopped, and you have not.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>At that moment, the truth struck Angulim\u0101la like lightning. The veil of ignorance that had shrouded his mind for so long was lifted. He saw, with absolute clarity, the horror of his deeds and the futility of his violence.</p>\n<p>Recognizing that this monk was none other than the Buddha himself, he threw down his sword and fell to his knees. With a heart filled with remorse and reverence, he bowed at the feet of the Blessed One and begged for ordination.</p>\n<p>The Buddha, the great teacher of boundless compassion, the refuge of the world with its gods and men, simply said:</p>\n<p>\"Come, bhikkhu.\"</p>\n<p>With these words, Angulim\u0101la was instantly ordained into the monastic order. <span id=\"Endnote32\">[<a href=\"#endnote32\">32</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>From that moment on, the man who had once been a ruthless killer devoted himself fully to the path of the Dhamma. Through dedicated practice, he transformed his mind, and before long, he attained arahantship\u2014perfect liberation.</p>\n<p>Thus, the most feared bandit of the land became one of the most revered disciples in the Buddha\u2019s dispensation, proving that no one is beyond redemption when met with wisdom and compassion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><img src=\"page7/image6.png\" /></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>Angulimala running after the Buddha. </b>Picture Courtesy: https://www.facebook.com/InnerDhamma/photos</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>The Blessed One\u2019s Mastery of Teaching</b></p>\n<p><b>Bhikkhu Bodhi eloquently describes the Buddha\u2019s extraordinary teaching abilities</b>: <span id=\"Endnote33\">[<a href=\"#endnote33\">33</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\u201cAs a skilled and versatile teacher, the Buddha adopted different styles of presentation to communicate the Dhamma to his disciples. Often, he would explain a teaching in detail (vitth\u0101rena). Having introduced his topic with a short statement or synopsis (uddesa), he would then elaborate (niddesa), analyzing it, drawing out its implications, and sometimes using similes (upam\u0101) to reinforce his point. Finally, he would restate his declaration as a conclusion (niggamana), now supported by the full weight of his analysis.\u201d</p>\n<p><b>\u201c</b>At other times, however, the Buddha would teach briefly (sa\u1e41khittena), offering only a concise, sometimes cryptic statement, rich with profound meaning. This was not to conceal an esoteric message but because brevity, in certain cases, was more effective in shaking and transforming the minds of his listeners. The purpose of his teachings was not merely to convey information but to inspire insight, wisdom, and liberation. By requiring his disciples to reflect deeply, engage in inquiry, and discuss the teachings, the Buddha ensured that his words would lead them toward true understanding\u201d</p>\n<p><b>The Blessed One Taught in Both Brief and Detailed Ways</b></p>\n<p>The Buddha himself affirmed:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cS\u0101riputta, I can teach the Dhamma briefly; I can teach the Dhamma in detail; I can teach the Dhamma both briefly and in detail. But those who can truly understand are rare.\u201d </i><span id=\"Endnote34\">[<a href=\"#endnote34\">34</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Before teaching, the Buddha carefully considered his audience, assessing their capacity to comprehend the Dhamma. With his extraordinary ability to perceive the spiritual maturity of beings (<i>indriya-paropariyatte \u00f1\u0101na</i>), <span id=\"Endnote35\">[<a href=\"#endnote35\">35</a>]</span>  he tailored his teachings accordingly. For those who needed extensive explanations, he expounded in detail with stories and similes. For those with keen wisdom, a brief but profound statement sufficed. Always, his teachings stemmed from great compassion\u2014his sole purpose was to guide beings out of the endless cycle of <i>sams\u0101ra</i> and toward liberation.</p>\n<p><b>Two Styles of the Buddha\u2019s Teachings</b></p>\n<p><b>Detailed Teachings: A Discourse with Subha the Brahmin Student </b><span id=\"Endnote36\">[<a href=\"#endnote36\">36</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>One time, a young Brahmin student named Subha approached the Blessed One and inquired why some people are born into fortunate circumstances while others suffer misfortune. He asked:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cWhy is it, Master Gotama, that some people are short-lived while others live long? Some are sickly while others are healthy, some ugly while others are beautiful, some poor while others are wealthy, some born into low status while others are highly regarded, and some foolish while others are wise?\u201d</i></p>\n<p>The Buddha responded:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cStudent, beings are the heirs of their actions, born from their actions, bound to their actions, and have their actions as their refuge. It is action (kamma) that distinguishes beings as inferior or superior.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>He then explained in detail:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\t<b>Lifespan:</b> Those who harm and kill others are reborn in unfortunate realms; if they return to the human world, they suffer short lives. But those who cultivate compassion and refrain from harming beings enjoy long lives when reborn as humans.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\t<b>Health:</b> Those who injure and torment others suffer illness in future lives, while those who protect and care for others experience good health.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\t<b>Beauty:</b> Those consumed by anger and hostility are reborn with unattractive features, while those who cultivate kindness and patience are reborn with beauty.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\t<b>Influence:</b> The envious and jealous are reborn without status or power, while those who rejoice in others\u2019 success and live without jealousy gain influence and respect.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\t<b>Wealth:</b> The miserly and greedy experience poverty in future lives, while the generous and charitable find themselves reborn in wealth.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\t<b>Birth Status</b>: Those who are arrogant and fail to honour the honourable are reborn into low status, whereas those who pay respect to the worthy are reborn into esteemed families.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>--\t<b>Wisdom</b>: Those who neglect to seek wisdom, who refuse to learn from the wise, are reborn foolish. But those who approach the learned, eager to understand wholesome and unwholesome actions, are reborn wise.</p>\n<p>Upon hearing this detailed explanation, Subha gained deep understanding of the workings of <i>kamma</i> and expressed his gratitude to the Buddha, becoming his devoted follower.<span id=\"Endnote37\">[<a href=\"#endnote37\">37</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Blessed One, with boundless wisdom and compassion, taught the Dhamma in ways suited to the needs of each being\u2014whether in depth or in brief\u2014always guiding them toward the path of liberation.</p>\n<p><b>With the K\u0101l\u0101mas of Kesaputta </b><span id=\"Endnote38\">[<a href=\"#endnote38\">38</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The K\u0101l\u0101mas of Kesaputta were a clan known for their intellect. One of the Buddha\u2019s most frequently quoted teachings was delivered to them during his stay in Kesaputta.</p>\n<p>The K\u0101l\u0101mas approached the Blessed One and said:</p>\n<p>\u201cBhante, various ascetics and brahmins come to Kesaputta. Each proclaims their own doctrine while denouncing those of others. We are perplexed and in doubt, Bhante\u2014how do we discern who speaks the truth and who speaks falsehood?\u201d</p>\n<p>The Buddha replied:</p>\n<p>\u201cIt is natural to be perplexed and to experience doubt when faced with uncertainty. Come, K\u0101l\u0101mas, do not accept something merely because it has been handed down through oral tradition, lineage, hearsay, or scripture. Do not rely on logical reasoning, inference, or deep contemplation alone. Do not accept something simply because it seems convincing or because the speaker appears competent. And do not believe something merely out of respect for your teacher.</p>\n<p>But when you know for yourselves: \u2018These things are unwholesome, blameworthy, and censured by the wise; if undertaken and practiced, they lead to harm and suffering,\u2019 then you should abandon them.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Buddha then explained what was meant by the unwholesome. He identified three roots of all immoral conduct and defiled states of mind: greed, hatred, and delusion.</p>\n<p>He asked the K\u0101l\u0101mas:</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you think, K\u0101l\u0101mas? When greed arises in a person, is it for their welfare or their harm?\u201d</p>\n<p>They replied:</p>\n<p>\u201cFor their harm, Bhante.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Buddha continued:</p>\n<p>\u201cA person consumed by greed, whose mind is overwhelmed by it, destroys life, takes what is not given, commits adultery, and speaks falsehood. They also encourage others to do likewise. Does this lead to harm and suffering for a long time?\u201d</p>\n<p>The K\u0101l\u0101mas affirmed:</p>\n<p>\u201cYes, Bhante.\u201d</p>\n<p>The same was applied to hatred and delusion. The Buddha asked if these states led to harm and suffering, and the K\u0101l\u0101mas agreed. Then he extended his teaching further, guiding them to understand that abandoning greed, hatred, and delusion is the path to well-being.</p>\n<p>The Blessed One then said:</p>\n<p>\u201cThus, K\u0101l\u0101mas, when I said: \u2018<b>Do not go by oral tradition \u2026 but when you know for yourselves that something is unwholesome, blameworthy, and censured by the wise\u2014when you see that it leads to harm and suffering\u2014you should abandon it,\u2019 I spoke for this reason</b>.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Buddha then inquired whether the absence of greed, hatred, and delusion would be beneficial. The K\u0101l\u0101mas agreed that the cultivation of wholesome qualities brings happiness, both to oneself and to others. The Blessed One then expounded on the benefits of wholesome actions and how the abandonment of unwholesome states leads to true liberation. In this way, he guided the K\u0101l\u0101mas toward the Dhamma\u2014not by demanding blind faith, but by encouraging their own reflection.</p>\n<p>At the conclusion of the discourse, the K\u0101l\u0101mas, deeply moved, venerated the Blessed One and said:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cExcellent, Bhante! \u2026 We go for refuge to the Blessed One, to the Dhamma, and to the Sa\u1e45gha of bhikkhus.

To highlight these succinct yet powerful teachings, we have selected the following extracts from the scriptures:</p>\n<p><b>With the Ascetic Bahiya Darichariya </b><span id=\"Endnote40\">[<a href=\"#endnote40\">40</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The <i>Ud\u0101na</i> records the story of B\u0101hiya as follows: <span id=\"Endnote41\">[<a href=\"#endnote41\">41</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>At one time, the Blessed One was dwelling near S\u0101vatth\u012b, in Jeta\u2019s Grove at An\u0101thapi\u1e47\u1e0dika\u2019s monastery. At that same time, B\u0101hiya of the Bark Robe was living near Supp\u0101raka, on the ocean\u2019s shore, venerated by many.</p>\n<p>One day, while in seclusion, B\u0101hiya reflected:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cAmong those in the world who are Worthy Ones or who have entered the path to Worthiness, I am one of them.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>A devat\u0101, who had been a relative of B\u0101hiya in a past life, perceived his thoughts and, out of compassion, came to him and said:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cB\u0101hiya, you are certainly not a Worthy One, nor is this practice of yours the path to Worthiness.\u201d</i></p>\n<p><i>When B\u0101hiya asked who a true Worthy One was, the devat\u0101 replied:</i></p>\n<p><i>\u201cIn the northern lands, there is a city called S\u0101vatth\u012b. There, at this very moment, dwells the Gracious One\u2014a Perfectly Enlightened Buddha\u2014who teaches the Dhamma for attaining Worthiness.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>Shaken by the devat\u0101\u2019s words, B\u0101hiya resolved to seek out the Buddha. Without delay, he undertook the long journey and eventually arrived at An\u0101thapi\u1e47\u1e0dika\u2019s monastery. Upon inquiring about the Blessed One, the monks informed him that the Buddha had gone to S\u0101vatth\u012b for alms.</p>\n<p>Eager to meet the Buddha, B\u0101hiya ran to the city and, upon seeing the Blessed One, approached, venerated him, and urgently requested Dhamma instruction. The Buddha, having already entered the village for alms, replied that it was not the proper time for teaching. B\u0101hiya, however, pleaded three times, each time receiving the same response. Yet, undeterred, he begged once more.</p>\n<p>At that moment, the Buddha saw with his divine vision that B\u0101hiya\u2019s life was nearing its end. Moved by great compassion, he taught him the Dhamma right then and there:</p>\n<p><i>\u201cB\u0101hiya, you should train yourself thus: In what is seen, let there be only what is seen; in what is heard, only what is heard; in what is sensed, only what is sensed; in what is cognized, only what is cognized. This is how you should train yourself\u2026\u201d</i></p>\n<p><i>\u201cWhen, B\u0101hiya, in what is seen there is only what is seen, in what is heard only what is heard, in what is sensed only what is sensed, in what is cognized only what is cognized\u2014then, you will not be \u2018with that.\u2019 Since you will not be \u2018with that,\u2019 you will not be \u2018in that.\u2019 Since you will not be \u2018in that,\u2019 you will not be here, nor hereafter, nor in between the two. Just this is the end of suffering.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>Upon hearing these words, B\u0101hiya\u2019s mind was instantly liberated from all attachment. Shortly afterward, he was killed by a cow.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><img src=\"page7/image7.jpeg\" />When the monks informed the Buddha of B\u0101hiya\u2019s passing, he instructed them to cremate his remains and erect a stupa in his honour. The Blessed One then declared B\u0101hiya D\u0101ruc\u012briya the disciple who attained direct knowledge in the shortest time. <span id=\"Endnote42\">[<a href=\"#endnote42\">42</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>Bhaiya meeting the Buddha</b>.

At that time, Potaliya had renounced his worldly affairs and considered himself a spiritual person. However, when the Blessed One addressed him as \u201chouseholder,\u201d Potaliya was displeased and angry, saying:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\u201cMaster Gotama, it is neither fitting nor proper that you address me as \u2018householder.\u2019</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Buddha, with compassion, inquired about the reason for Potaliya\u2019s displeasure. Potaliya replied:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\u201cMaster Gotama, I have given up all my wealth, grain, silver, and gold to my children as their inheritance.

This is how I have renounced all my affairs and works.\u201d</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Buddha gently explained that true renunciation in his dispensation was different from what Potaliya had practiced. Realizing the depth of the Buddha\u2019s wisdom, Potaliya, who had some insight, humbly requested the Buddha to elaborate on his teaching of renunciation. The Blessed One shared profound insight, and by the end of the discourse, Potaliya's anger was transformed into reverence. With a heart filled with gratitude, Potaliya said:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\u201cVenerable sir, the Blessed One has inspired in me love for recluses, confidence in recluses, and reverence for recluses\u2026 Master Gotama, you have made the Dhamma clear in so many ways, as though turning upright what had been overthrown, revealing what was hidden, showing the way to one who was lost, or holding up a lamp in the dark for those with eyesight to see forms.

This led to complaints and criticism from the people of the town:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\u201cThe ascetic Gotama is making us childless; he\u2019s making us widows. He\u2019s breaking up good families! A thousand dreadlocked ascetics have now gone forth because of him, and also these two hundred and fifty wanderers who were disciples of Sa\u00f1caya. All these well-known gentlemen from Magadha are practicing the spiritual life under the ascetic Gotama.\u201d</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Despite the growing number of followers, the Buddha remained focused on his mission of teaching the Dhamma with love and wisdom. His work was misunderstood by many, but he knew the profound impact his teachings would have in the long run.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>On another occasion, while the Buddha was dwelling in R\u0101jagaha, a Brahmin named Akkosaka Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja heard that his fellow Brahmin, a member of the Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja clan, had gone forth into homelessness under the ascetic Gotama. Filled with anger, he approached the Buddha and harshly reviled him with rude words. Yet, the Blessed One, with his boundless compassion and patience, did not respond with anger. Instead, he imparted a brief but powerful teaching: <span id=\"Endnote35\">[<a href=\"#endnote35\">35</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i>\u201cOne who repays an angry man with anger only makes things worse for himself.

His heart softened, and he understood that the Buddha was not an enemy to be fought but a compassionate teacher. In that moment, Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja let go of his resentment and became one of the Buddha\u2019s disciples, finding peace and clarity in the Dhamma.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Through this profound encounter, we see how the Buddha\u2019s wisdom transformed even the harshest critics, leading them to the path of understanding, compassion, and ultimately, liberation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>The Buddhas\u2019 empathy</b></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Buddha, throughout his life, received both praise and blame from people of all walks of life, yet he responded to each with remarkable wisdom, universal compassion, and a deep understanding of human nature. Whether praised as the supreme teacher or criticized by those who misunderstood his path, the Buddha remained unmoved by ego or pride. He understood that human reactions were often shaped by ignorance, fear, or attachment, and he responded with patience, clarity, and empathy.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In the face of praise, the Buddha did not indulge in self-congratulation but recognized that any good attributed to him was a reflection of the Dhamma, the truth he taught. In the face of blame, he did not retaliate but offered teachings that encouraged self-reflection and liberation from suffering. His wisdom allowed him to see beyond superficial judgments and penetrate to the deeper motivations and concerns of those who praised or blamed him.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Buddha\u2019s compassion was not limited to humans; it extended to all beings. His responses were always guided by the understanding that true transformation comes not through force or criticism, but through awakening the mind and heart to the realities of life. In this way, he became the ideal teacher, showing that the path to peace and liberation lies in wisdom, compassion, and equanimity\u2014qualities that transcend all praise and blame.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>With that inspiring note we will end this section.

According to the scriptures, the Buddha would reveal his past lives on special occasions\u2014either to clarify a point of Dhamma or in response to a request from his disciples. Below are selected excerpts in which the Blessed One spoke of his former existences:</p>\n<p><b>As an Attendant to Brahm\u0101 Baka </b><span id=\"Endnote18\">[<a href=\"#endnote18\">18</a>]</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>On one occasion, Brahm\u0101 Baka mistakenly believed that his existence was eternal.

Tath\u0101gatas do not smile for no reason.\u201d</i></p>\n<p>Approaching the Buddha, Venerable \u0100nanda inquired about the cause of his smile. The Blessed One then revealed that in a distant past, this very place had been a prosperous town called Vebhali\u1e45ga, where the monastery of the former Buddha Kassapa once stood. He recounted how a humble potter named Gha\u1e6d\u012bk\u0101ra, a devoted disciple of Buddha Kassapa, had inspired his close friend, the young brahmin student Jotip\u0101la, to visit the Enlightened One. Upon hearing the Dhamma, Jotip\u0101la became a disciple of the Buddha Kassapa.

He instructed his royal barber:</p>\n<p><b>\u201cWhen you see the first grey hair upon my head, inform me at once.\u201d</b></p>\n<p>In due course, the barber discovered a single strand of grey hair and reported it to the king.
