<b><i>Homage to the Buddha, the Perfected One, the fully Awakened One!!!</i></b>
<b>Introduction</b>
This publication is a humble endeavour to present the life of the Buddha as recorded in the Pali Tripitaka—referred to here as the suttas or scriptures. Over the millennia, countless commentaries and folklore have enriched the narratives of the Buddha’s life, resulting in various versions being passed down across Buddhist traditions. However, this compilation seeks to return to the earliest accounts, drawing directly from the Pali Tipitaka—the very stories the Buddha himself shared about his childhood, his ministry, the people he encountered, and the journeys he undertook. From his birth in Lumbini to his final passing-away in Kusinara, this collection traces his extraordinary path, fittingly titled: "<b>From Lumbini to Kusinara – A Life Inspired: The Wonderful Journey of Our Gotama Buddha."</b>
Around 2,600 years ago, the Buddha delivered his first sermon—the Dhammacakkap -pavattana Sutta—at the Deer Park in Varanasi, India, to his former ascetic companions. That moment marked the turning of the Wheel of Dhamma, setting in motion a profound spiritual awakening. For the next forty-five years, he walked the lands of northern and eastern India, known in those times as Majjhimadesa (the Central Region of Dambadiva). He wandered through villages and cities, establishing a monastic order and sharing the timeless Dhamma with people from all walks of life.
Born into royal privilege, the Buddha renounced a life of luxury in pursuit of truth, seeking the path to the complete cessation of suffering. Many who heard his teachings—both men and women—became his disciples, some even attaining the highest realization: Nibbāna.
This compilation is an offering of gratitude for the priceless Dhamma—the Blessed One’s teachings, which continue to illuminate the path for countless beings. In this spirit, it is fitting to recall the words of Vidagama Maha Thero from the <i>Budugunaalankāraya</i>, which beautifully express the reverence one feels in making even the simplest offering to the Buddha:
<i>The Blessed One was honoured
And revered with celestial coral flowers.
I have only this humble work to offer to Him, the Great Sage.
My gift is but a wildflower—
Yet who can say it is unworthy?</i>
With the same humility and devotion, we present this work in homage to the Blessed One.
May all beings be happy!
May all beings attain Nibbāna!
